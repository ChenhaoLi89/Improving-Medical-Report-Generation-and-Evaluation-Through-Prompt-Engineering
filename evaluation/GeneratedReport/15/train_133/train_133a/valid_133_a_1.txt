The evaluation was limited due to the presence of mediastinal vascular structures and the cardiac examination being performed without intravenous contrast. The main vascular structures of the mediastinum as well as the heart contour and size appear abnormal. A significant pericardial effusion and thickening were noted. However, both the trachea and main bronchi are occluded. The luminal assessment revealed considerable occlusive pathology. The thoracic esophagus exhibited azced cal Ã¥twenburg radical abnormalities leading to substantial wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were present in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilum-axilla areas. Upon examining the lung parenchyma, unilateral aeration was found to be compromised, and a significant nodular lesion was detected within the lung parenchyma. Additionally, an extensive pleural effusion-thickening was identified. The upper abdominal organs observed are unusual, with a concerning space-occupying lesion noted in the segments of the liver documented. The right adrenal gland showed abnormal features, and a significant space-occupying lesion was detected. The bone structures in the study area appeared severely altered, and the vertebral corpus heights were markedly reduced. This indicates potential concerns regarding underlying conditions necessitating further investigation.
