The trachea is positioned slightly to the side of both main bronchi, and a significant obstructive pathology was noted within the lumen. The mediastinum was optimally evaluated during the non-contrast examination, with mediastinal main vascular structures and heart contour showing abnormalities in size and shape. Pericardial effusion was observed alongside significant thickening. The thoracic esophagus showed signs of abnormal calibration, and marked tumoral wall thickening was detected. An unusual type of hiatal hernia was present at the lower part of the esophagus. Enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary areas showed pathological dimensions and were noted. Upon evaluating the lung parenchyma, no pleuroparenchymal fibroatelectasis sequelae were identified in the medial aspect of the middle lobe of the right lung. A mass lesion with indistinguishable borders displaying active infiltration was discovered in both lungs. The upper abdominal organs exhibited significant abnormalities as observable in sections. A space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that extended into the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands displayed changes indicative of serious issues, and significant space-occupying lesions were noted. Robust degenerative changes were apparent in the bone structures throughout the examination region.
