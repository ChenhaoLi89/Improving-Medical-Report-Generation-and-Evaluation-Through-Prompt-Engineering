The trachea and main bronchi remain patent, with no significant pathological changes regarding wall thickening noted in the esophagus. However, abnormalities were found in the mediastinal lymph nodes, raising concerns of possible pathological enlargement. The heart and mediastinal vascular structures could be adequately assessed thanks to the use of optimal contrast, revealing no unusual appearances. Notably, pleural effusion and thickening were observed in both hemithorax. Upon examination of both lung parenchyma, multiple active lesions and significant mass infiltrations were identified. Interestingly, advanced sequelae changes alongside several millimetric nodules have also been noted, presenting as potentially concerning findings. No pathologies were detected within the evaluated sections through the lower part of the abdomen. However, suspicious sub-perceptual lesions within the integrity of the bone structures suggest further monitoring is warranted. Overall, while the major structural integrity appears preserved, surprising findings related to both lymphatic and pulmonary statuses could present clinical considerations for further investigation. Regular follow-up appointments might be necessary to reassess thoracic conditions. This evaluation underscores the importance of holistic diagnosis and further evaluation to ensure that any significant changes are promptly identified and addressed.
