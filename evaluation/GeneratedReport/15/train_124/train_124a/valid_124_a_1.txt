The trachea and both main bronchi show narrowing with resultant obstruction. Significant pathology was identified in the trachea and both main bronchi. Ventilation in both lungs is abnormal, and a mass or infiltrative lesion was noted in the left lung. Due to the lack of contrast material, evaluation of the mediastinal structures remains incomplete. Based on available views, the heart appears enlarged and its contours are irregular. There is significant pleural accumulation detected, along with fluid around the heart. The dimensions of the main vascular structures in the mediastinum are altered beyond normal limits. Pathological lymph node enlargement is evident in both the mediastinum and hilar regions. There is a considerable pathological increase in wall thickness in the esophagus observed in cross-sections. Notably, no hiatal or paraesophageal hernia was found at the esophagusâ€™s lower point. Evidence of free fluid collection in the upper abdomen has been identified within the sections, and enlarged lymph nodes of significant size are present. Pertaining to this examination, a distinguishable mass was found in one of the upper abdominal organs. Additionally, fractures and lytic-destructive lesions were noted in the bone structures within the examined sections.
