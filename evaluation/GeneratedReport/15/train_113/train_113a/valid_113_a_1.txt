The cardiothoracic orientation (CTO) is noted to be outside the normal range. All the main mediastinal vascular structures show an atypical calibration. Abnormal thymic tissue is present in the anterior mediastinum with an irregular configuration, causing a significant mass effect, accompanied by hypodense areas incompatible with fat involution. Enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum were identified, having a pathological size and configuration. Furthermore, abnormal lymph nodes were found at both hilar levels. The hemithoraxes are asymmetrical, indicating possible pathology. The bronchial and tracheal calibration appears severely distorted, with obstructed lumens. In regard to the thoracic esophagus, significant tumoral wall thickening is present. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and subcarinal regions were noted, with pathological dimensions observed in the bilateral hilar-axillary areas. Imaging of the lung parenchyma shows no nodules, nor any lesions to report consistent with pneumonia. Evaluating the upper abdominal organs revealed no calculi; notably, the left kidney displayed increased density. The adrenal glands showed atypical structure, and space-occupying lesions were noted. While there is evidence of significant degenerative changes in local bone structures, they are not pronounced.
