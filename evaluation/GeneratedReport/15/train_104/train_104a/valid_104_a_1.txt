The trachea and both main bronchi appear unremarkable. The dimensions and outline of the heart are abnormal, and the shape of the mediastinal main vascular structures indicates potential abnormalities. A significant increase in the diameter of the thoracic aorta was observed. Pericardial effusion is present, and extensive thickening was detected around it. No calcific plaques were found in the coronary arteries. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus showed irregularities, and significant wall thickening corresponding to tumors was noted. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar axillary areas. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window, notable bronchiectasis was found predominantly in the peripheral regions of both lungs. Considerable infiltration within the lung parenchyma was observed. There is notable pleural effusion with varying degrees of thickening present. Evaluation of the upper abdominal organs reveals considerable density retention in the liver, while no stones were found in the gallbladder. Increased irritation of the thoracic vertebrae is evident, along with significant fibrotic densities noted in the proximal lung parenchyma. This assessment serves to document the overall health of the thorax and abdomen without major incident, while highlighting areas requiring further investigation.
