The trachea and both main bronchi are clear with no signs of occlusive pathology. There is a significant increase in wall thickness observed in the thoracic esophagus, along with a moderate fixed hiatal hernia noted at the lower end. Due to the lack of IV contrast, the examination of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac assessments were inadequate. Notably, the thoracic aorta shows no evidence of calcified atheroma plaques. The ascending aorta measures 42 mm in its diameter, which indicates a normal shape and size. Pericardial and pleural effusions were detected, and thickness increase is present. Lymph nodes of pathological size in both axillary regions were identified. In the analysis of the lung parenchyma, multiple active infiltrations and significant mass lesions were evident in both lungs. There are pronounced emphysematous transformations within the upper lobes, with bronchiectasis reported on the right side more prominently than left. There is mild peribronchial thickening present, though no nodules were seen in either lung. In the upper abdominal sections, a 28x20 mm lesion located in the corpus of the left adrenal gland was identified as a potential metastasis. No hyperdense stones are reported in kidney areas, and a notable intraabdominal fluid collection was found. Assessment of intraabdominal lymph nodes verified pathological sizes, while a destructive lesion in the bone structures was detected within the image.
