The examination was conducted without contrast, and the evaluation of the mediastinal structures was determined to be optimal. The trachea and lumens of both main bronchi are partially obstructed, but no significant occlusive pathology has been identified within them. The mediastinal major vascular structures appear abnormal. No calcific atherosclerotic changes were observed in the thoracic aorta or the coronary arteries. Heart size is normal, showing no signs of cardiomegaly. Pleural thickening effusion was detected. The esophagus showed abnormal calibration, with significant pathological wall thickening present at the examination limits. Lymph nodes with pathological size and appearance were seen in the mediastinum and bilateral hilar regions. On examining the lung parenchyma, substantial peribronchial thickening was noted centrally in both lungs, with pronounced emphysematous changes also observed. Compared to previous examinations, the size and number of nonspecific parenchymal nodules have decreased; the largest nodule identified was 4 mm in the upper lobe of the right lung. Mass infiltrations were successfully detected in both lung parenchyma. No pleuroparenchymal sequelae density variations were noted in the right middle lobe or the posterior segment of the left lung, with no bulla formations present either. Upper abdominal sections showed significant abnormalities. A two-centimeter solid mass was observed in the lower pole of the left kidney. Bilateral adrenal gland size was abnormal, with noted space-occupying lesions. Lytic-destructive lesions were found in various bone structures.
