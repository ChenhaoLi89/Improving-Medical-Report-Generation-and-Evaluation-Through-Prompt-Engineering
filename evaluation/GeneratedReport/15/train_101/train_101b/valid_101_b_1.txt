Both the trachea and main bronchi were noted to be deviated from the midline, and obstructive pathology was detected within the lumen. The mediastinum was optimally evaluated in this non-contrast examination. Observations regarding the calibration of the mediastinal main vascular structures suggest abnormal findings. There were no atherosclerotic calcifications noted in the thoracic-abdominal aorta or coronary arteries. The heart size appears reduced. Both the mitral and aortic valves are free of calcification. A significant pericardial effusion was observed, alongside thickening. The thoracic esophagus exhibited abnormal calibration, with significant tumoral wall thickening detected. Enlarged lymph nodes were present in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, with pathological dimensions identified. Examination of the lung parenchyma revealed significant peribronchial thinning in the periphery of the lungs. Similarly, emphysematous changes were not visible in either lung. There were no bullae observed at the lung apex regions. The left hemidiaphragm is flattened. No pleuroparenchymal sequelae were detected in the specified lobes of the lungs, nor were there any mass lesions or active infiltration noted. Instead, cyst formations were ruled out. A large wall cyst was identified in the upper pole of the left kidney. Abnormal calibration of the bilateral adrenal glands was reported. Osteoporosis was absent in the bone structures with Verderbral corpus heights low.
