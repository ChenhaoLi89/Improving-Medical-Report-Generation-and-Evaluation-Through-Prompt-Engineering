The trachea and both main bronchi showed mild obstructive pathology in the lumen. Although a non-contrast examination was performed, the mediastinum was evaluated optimally, revealing pathologic changes in the main vascular structures and heart size. Notable pericardial effusion-thickening was present. New atherosclerotic wall calcifications were observed in the intra-abdominal portion of the aortic arch and along the coronary arteries; the aortic valve presented as normal. Something unusual was noted in the distal esophagus with complex wall thickening, not pre-existing, evident through a segment extending beyond 6 cm. Complications were noted with thickness measured just at a mild level. In this region, pre-esophageal lymph nodes were absent. Lung imaging showed no significant emphysematous changes however the mosaics region reflected enhanced solid areas. Bilateral sub-carinal nodes expanded in size where variable at 10x7 mm. Undesirable bronchial thickness and blockages were prevalent. The additional nodular trends within upper bilaterals suggested regions possibly pre-malignant versus physiologic characteristics. Changes attributed to pleuroparenchymal normality were expected in-pleural, no identifiable lesions discovered amidst surrounding tissues showcased cystic formations. Assessments of visible abdominal organs remained unchanged; nonetheless, minimal volumes of these were notably clearer. Gallbladder observations indicated residual calculi with varying diameters. Overall density assessments for the sac involved segmented impacts, with significant changes appearing within vertebrae structures reported in connective discontinuity.
