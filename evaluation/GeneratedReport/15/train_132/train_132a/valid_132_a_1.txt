The trachea and both main bronchi are clear and unobstructed. There are no expansive lesions or significant obstructive lesions found in the trachea or bronchi. Notable pleuroparenchymal scarring is present in the lung apexes, and there are mild fibrotic changes noted in both lungs. There are emphysematous changes in the lungs, particularly pronounced in the left lung. Both lungs display numerous enlarged nodules, the largest measuring approximately 8 mm, situated in the inferior segment of the right lung. However, there are infiltrative lesions present in both lungs. The mediastinal structures can be adequately assessed as contrast material was administered. The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged, and there is possible pleural effusion noted. The diameters of the mediastinal vascular structures are abnormal. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were observed in both the mediastinal and hilar areas. Thickening of the esophageal wall was evident in the observed sections. There is, however, evidence of significant free fluid collection in the upper abdomen, and various organs show masses with well-defined borders identified in contrast-enhanced CT imaging. The thoracic vertebral bodies exhibit some signs of pathological height loss and structural misalignments. There was narrowing of intervertebral disc spaces, and certain neural foramina appear occluded. Additionally, lytic-destructive lesions were identified in the bony architecture upon examination in the sections examined.
