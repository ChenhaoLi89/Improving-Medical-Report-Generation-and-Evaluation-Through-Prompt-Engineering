The trachea and both main bronchi are partially constricted. The mediastinal vascular structures and heart contour show irregularities, and the heart size appears enlarged. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is abnormal. A significant pericardial effusion was observed. The thoracic esophagus shows abnormal calibration with notable tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were detected in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window, aeration is compromised, and suspect nodular lesions were identified throughout the lung parenchyma. Found within the pleural cavity is thickening and a moderate effusion. The upper abdominal organs observed in the sections appear abnormal. Interestingly, space-occupying lesions were detected in the liver within the cross-sectional area. Liver parenchyma reveals no changes suggestive of steatosis. Both adrenal glands were noted to have mild abnormalities with evidence of space-occupying lesions. When assessing bone structures in the study area, signs of degeneration were observed. Vertebral corpus heights seem notably decreased.
