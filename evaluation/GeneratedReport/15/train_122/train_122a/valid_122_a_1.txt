The trachea, along with both main bronchi, are patent. The mediastinal major vascular structures, as well as the overall contour and size of the heart, appear abnormal. A significant pericardial effusion and thickening were noted. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is abnormal, with prominent pathological wall thickening detected. Enlarged lymph nodes within the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions are evident and are considered pathological. Upon examining the lung parenchyma window, aeration of both lungs is compromised, and several nodular and infiltrative lesions are identified in the lung tissue. Pleural effusion and thickening within the lungs are prominently observed. Evaluation of the upper abdominal organs reveals multiple abnormalities. A considerable space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver-sized area, warranting further investigation. Both adrenal glands exhibit signs suggestive of subtle infiltration, indicating potential pathology. The bony structures of the study area are abnormal. Notably, the vertebral corpus heights are diminished due to compression fractures. Therefore, overall impression identifies significant discrepancies requiring clinical correlation and further diagnostic assessment for conclusive care.
