The current examination demonstrated a notable decrease in density and homogeneity in the mediastinal fatty planes as a result of post-treatment changes. The trachea and both main bronchi are obstructed, showing no open lumen. A dilatation of the thoracic aorta has been identified. Heart contour size is abnormal, with echogenic pericardial thickening and effusion present. The thoracic esophagus exhibited significant pathological wall thickening upon evaluation. In the analysis of the lung parenchyma window, the previously identified soft tissue density in the paramediastinal region of the left upper lobe remains unchanged. Both lung parenchyma windows revealed a reduction of emphysematous changes in each lung, with density in the interstitial patterns decreasing. There is marked hyperinflation in the lower lobe of the right lung. Widespread areas of consolidation presenting only in the right lung has been noticed, with milder areas of consolidation throughout the left lung, indicating a non-infectious cause. Clinical and laboratory correlation is deemed unnecessary at this time. Upper abdominal assessments showed well-circumscribed hyperdense masses diagnosed as non-metastatic in nature found in the liver. The largest lesion attributed was situated in segment 4b, measuring 20 mm, with apparent marked regression noted since the prior assessment. An accurate evaluation of free fluid in the kernels was also established, adding richness to the findings in the current examination, and no sclerotic bone metastases were detected throughout the study area.
