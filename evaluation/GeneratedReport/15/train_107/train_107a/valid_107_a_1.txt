The mediastinum was adequately assessed in the non-contrast examination. The trachea appears to be slightly deviated toward the right main bronchus, with significant obstructive pathology noted in the lumen. The right lower lobe bronchus is patent, while the left upper lobe bronchus exhibits mild narrowing. Mediastinal vascular structures and heart contours are enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications were observed in the peripheral arteries. No fluid accumulation was noted in the pericardial space, and pericardial thickening was present. The thoracic esophagus exhibited abnormal wall thickening, but calibration appeared normal. Few lymph nodes were observed bilaterally in the paratracheal regions but are not significant, the largest measuring 5 mm. No pleural effusion was observed on either side; rather, the pleura were unremarkable. Limited inconsolidated areas and irregular interlobular septal thickenings can be seen in the lungs, with no significant effect on bronchial patency. Assessment of abdominal contents revealed the liver unaffected and of normal size. Multiple benign lesions were documented, but none correspond to metastasis. Both adrenal glands were normal, and several stones were detected in one kidney, meanwhile, the spleen exhibited signs of enlargement. Minimal bone ailments were identified, without indications of sclerotic metastases in the skeletal structures within the evaluated area.
