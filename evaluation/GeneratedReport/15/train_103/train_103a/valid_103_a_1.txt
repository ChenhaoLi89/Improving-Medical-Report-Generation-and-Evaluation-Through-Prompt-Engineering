The trachea and lumen of both main bronchi remain patent, with no evidence of occlusive pathology present. However, the evaluation of mediastinal structures appears suboptimal due to the unenhanced nature of the examination. The calibration of thoracic vascular structures is noted as enlarged. Heart size was reported to be diminished. There were signs of pericardial thickening and moderate effusion noted. The evaluation revealed no prosthetic material in the aortic valve, and there was no evidence of post-operative suture materials in the ascending aorta. The thoracic esophagus shows abnormal calibration, with significant pathological wall thickening detected. Several lymph nodes, measuring 19x11 mm, were not identified in any of the locational regions mentioned. Current lung parenchyma windows reveal clear and consistent integrity without any consolidation or other indications of disease. Ground glass density increases were not present in either lung area. The appearance does not underscore any trends suggestive of ongoing infectious processes warranting further evaluation. No noticeable interseptal thickenings were detected, and no free fluid accumulation was observed either in the pleural spaces. Both lung areas exhibit healthy characteristics without significant mass lesions following non-enhanced examination protocols. Abdominal sections evaluated were noted as abnormal. The bilateral adrenal glands were found irregular, indicating potential space-occupying lesions. There are no metallic suture materials in the sternum or evidence of lytic-destructive lesions in the bone structures.
