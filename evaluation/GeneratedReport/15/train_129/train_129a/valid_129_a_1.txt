The trachea was slightly deviated, and slight obstructive pathology was detected in the lumen of both main bronchi. The mediastinum was optimally evaluated; the major vascular structures, as well as the heart's contour and size, were found to be abnormal. A significant amount of pericardial effusion and thickening was observed. Calibration of the thoracic esophagus appeared abnormal, accompanied by marked pathological wall thickening. A sliding type hiatal hernia was noted in the middle section of the esophagus, rather than its lower end. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological characteristics were detected in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. In the lung parenchyma window examination, several parenchymal nodules greater than 5 mm in diameter were identified in the left lung, along with a substantial mass lesion in both lungs showing active infiltration with indistinguishable borders. Upper abdominal organs displayed abnormal findings, including a major space-occupying liver lesion. Both adrenal glands displayed marked pathology and were found to contain significant lesions. Severe scoliosis with right opening was observed at the thoracic level, along with varied vertebral corpus height retention. Overall, the examination brings several significant abnormalities across various thoracic and abdominal systems into focus, necessitating further evaluation and follow-up.
