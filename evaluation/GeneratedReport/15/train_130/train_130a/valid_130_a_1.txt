The CTO is observed to be within the abnormal range. The calibration of the aortic arch appears artificial, while the calibration of other mediastinal vascular structures shows abnormalities. Calcific atheroma plaques are absent in the aortic arch and right subclavian artery. There are calcific atheromatous plaques prominently located in the peripheral arteries. A nasogastric tube is seen in the case. In the context of laryngeal cancer history, a mass taking up a considerable amount of space in the larynx is seen, but it appears to only slightly infiltrate surrounding soft tissues. The patient surprisingly does not have a tracheostomy cannula noted. Within the study area, an air collection is evident in the neck but not extending down to the thorax. The mediastinum shows no signs of pneumomediastinum, with characteristics appearing homogeneous. Contrarily, subcutaneous emphysema was not identified at the supraclavicular level. Lymph nodes in both the mediastinum and hila are noted to be of pathological size and configuration. Both hemithorax are found to be asymmetrical. The trachea and main bronchi show considerable obstruction, with no visible airways. The thoracic esophagus has significant tumoral wall thickening detected. In the lung parenchyma window, there are densities not consistent with pleural-related changes observed. Prominent abnormalities in the upper upper Segment appear infectious in nature. Near the falciform ligament, increased echogenicity in the liver is noted. The spleen and pancreas have minor abnormalities. No visualized degenerative changes in nearby bone structures were covered.
