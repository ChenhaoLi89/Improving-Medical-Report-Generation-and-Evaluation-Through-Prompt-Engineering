A catheter image was visualized extending from the left internal jugular vein to the right atrium. Significant obstructive pathology was detected in the trachea and lumen of both main bronchi. The mediastinum was evaluated adequately in the non-contrast examination. Significant findings include an increase in heart size and distorted heart contour, raising concerns. A large transparent effusion was noted in the pericardial space. The thoracic esophagus showed abnormal calibration, and there was considerable tumoral wall thickening observed. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were noted in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. In addition, upon examining the lung parenchyma window, no peribronchial thickening, centriacinar nodules, or ground-glass opacities were found in the patient's lungs, who was being monitored for ongoing the development of consolidation in the lung tissue. Nodular consolidation was not noted in the right lungâ€™s lower lobe laterobasal segment. Instable hyperdense lesions measuring 19 mm in maximum diameter were not visible in both liver segments 1 and 2 as per upper abdominal CT scans. No calculus was found in the gallbladder. Significant anomalies were determined wrongly in the examination compared to prior findings at this point, warranting further investigation in subsequent visits.
