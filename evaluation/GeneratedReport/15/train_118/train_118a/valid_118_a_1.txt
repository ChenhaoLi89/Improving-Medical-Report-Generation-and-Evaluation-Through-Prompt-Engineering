The trachea and the lumen of both main bronchi are clear and unobstructed. However, peculiarities were noted in the mediastinal structures due to the examination being unenhanced. The evaluation of major vascular structures in the mediastinum appeared abnormal, showing signs of dilation. The heart contour was assessed as slightly enlarged. Mild pericardial effusion was identified. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated abnormal calibration with noted significant wall thickening present. Lymphadenopathies were noted primarily in the mediastinal, upper paratracheal, lower paratracheal, subcarinal regions, and the right paratracheal-right hilar region, with the largest having a short axis measurement of 5 mm and displaying a non-conglomerate form. In the lung parenchyma assessment, no thickenings were detected, but fibrotic areas have been observed in both lung areas. The predefined broad consolidation was traced specifically to the upper lobe anterior segment and appears distinguishable from nearby structures, accompanied by clear densities. Radiographic indications pointed towards a possible bacterial infection rather than a fungal one. A correlation with clinical findings is required to connect symptoms with imaging results. Mild cysts were identified balanced in distribution throughout both kidneys, while no distinct lesions identifiable to character were located within the spleen. Furthermore, highly dense lesions were attributed to excess fat in the liver, potentially redundant. No lesions of any shape or size were observed throughout bone structures in the body.
