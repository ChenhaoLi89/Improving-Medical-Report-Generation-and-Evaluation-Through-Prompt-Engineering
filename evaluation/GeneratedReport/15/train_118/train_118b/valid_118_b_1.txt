The evaluation of mediastinal structures was performed with optimal quality since the examination was contrast-enhanced. None of the trachea or the main bronchi showed signs of occlusive pathology. An image revealed a catheter extending inferiorly from the vena cava. The calibration of the thoracic main vascular structures was abnormal, and significant dilatation was noted in the thoracic aorta. The heart size was measured to be enlarged, and pericardial thickening-effusion was present. Detailed examination of the thoracic esophagus showed atypical wall thickening with a noteworthy pathology. Compared to the previous evaluation, there were unstable local conglomerated lymphadenopathies evident in the mediastinal upper-lower paratracheal, subcarinal area, and in the right paratracheal and hilar regions, with the short axis of the largest node fitting within 12 mm. The lung parenchyma window revealed no peribronchial thickening, and there was significant regression in the nodular consolidation areas observed previously in both lungs. In contrast, regarding pleural effusion, only a small collection of fluid was noted, measuring 5 mm on the right and negligible on the left. The current analysis showed that the pericardial area had clear evidence of no effusion. Upper abdominal sections did not present any focal lesions, and the previous hypodense lesions in liver segments 8 and 7 demonstrated slight variation without significant implications. No adverse findings were identified during the examination.
