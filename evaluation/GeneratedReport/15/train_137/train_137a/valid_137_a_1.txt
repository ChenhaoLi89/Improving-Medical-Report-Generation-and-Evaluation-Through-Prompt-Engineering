The report indicates an increased CTO with respect to the heart, while the mediastinal main vascular structures show abnormalities. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is enlarged. There is observed pericardial effusion and thickening. The thoracic esophagus exhibits irregular calibration, revealing significant tumoral wall thickening. Additionally, an umbilical hernia is noted. pathological-sized lymph nodes were detected at the mediastinal and hilar levels. Evaluation of the lung parenchyma window reveals asymmetry in both hemithoraxes. The trachea and main bronchi show abnormal calibration, with lumens being obstructed. Ground glass densities and consolidative parenchyma areas are present only in the right lung, alongside detected bilateral pleural effusion and pneumothorax. All surrounding soft tissue plans appear to be deviating from the natural state, while degenerative changes are absent in the bone structure. There is no evidence of significant pulmonary disease, with no notable concerns relating to vascular structure dimensions or pericardial thickness. Overall, this report underscores both the normality and abnormalities of cardiovascular and respiratory elements, indicating various conditions that may require further evaluation.
