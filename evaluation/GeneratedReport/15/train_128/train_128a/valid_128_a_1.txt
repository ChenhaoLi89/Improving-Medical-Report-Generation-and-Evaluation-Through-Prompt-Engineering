The CTO is abnormal. The ascending aorta measurements reveal a calibration of 35 mm, which is narrower than expected. The descending aorta appears normal in size. The aortic arch measures 30 mm, indicating it is within the normal range. The calibrations of other major vascular structures in the mediastinum are abnormal. No catheter appearance is detected in the superior vena cava. There is evidence of calcific atheromas in the pulmonary arteries, but strikingly none are found in the aortic arch or coronary arteries. Several lymph nodes of pathological size and configuration were noted in the mediastinum. Abnormal lymph nodes are present bilaterally at the hilar regions. The thoracic esophagus displays significant tumoral wall thickening. Evaluating both lungs reveals that tracheal and bronchial calibrations are irregular, and thickening of bronchioles is absent. No bronchovascular sheath prominence is seen, and apical levels show excessive emphysema. Striking changes akin to pleuroparenchymal sequelae are present only in the left lung. Three nodules measuring 4 mm, 5.5 mm, and 2 mm respectively, in different lung segments appear unstable and require monitoring. Severe sequelae alter the left lung's lower areas. Gallbladder findings reveal a normal examination without distension. Kidney contours are rounded and smooth. Furthermore, no calcific atheromas are identified in the abdominal aorta. There are no signs of degeneration in the bone structure. Fractures observed in the lower ribs are entirely new, contradicting previous reviews.
