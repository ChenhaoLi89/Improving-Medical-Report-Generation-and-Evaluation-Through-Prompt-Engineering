The trachea and both main bronchi appear obstructed. Due to limitations in the non-contrast examination, a thorough assessment of the mediastinum could not be performed. However, the heart's contour and size of mediastinal vascular structures are abnormal. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is significantly reduced. Additionally, substantial pericardial effusion and thickening were noted in the assessment. The thoracic esophagus exhibited abnormal calibration, showing signs of potential tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes in both prevascular and pre-paratracheal regions, as well as bilateral hilar-axillary areas, presented with pathological dimensions. Evaluation of lung parenchyma revealed decreased aeration, with multiple nodular and infiltrative lesions identified within the lung. A significant pleural effusion and thickening were observed. The examination of upper abdominal organs displayed abnormalities, with space-occupying lesions detected in the liver. Bilateral adrenal glands were noted to be enlarged, with additional space-occupying lesions present. In the left kidney, further findings in the upper pole pelvicalyceal structure raised concerns regarding major calculus. The bone structures in the studied area showed significant degenerative changes, with diminished vertebral corpus heights evident. Overall, these findings highlight several areas of potential concern requiring further evaluation and follow-up.
