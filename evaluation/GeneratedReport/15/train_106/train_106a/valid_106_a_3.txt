The heart's contour and size appear abnormal, with moderate pleural and pericardial effusion detected. Mediastinal vascular structures exhibit significant irregularities. There are multimetric obstructive atheroma plaques in the left coronary artery. Lymphadenopathies are absent in the prevascular, paratracheal, and subcarinal regions. The largest lymphadenopathies reported are observed in the paratracheal area and measure 8x10 mm and 10x8 mm, respectively. An increase in pathological wall thickness in the esophagus is noted. An occlusive pathology was detected in both main bronchi, and a large endobronchial mass in the right lung presented bilateral involvement. The size was clearly measured at 18 mm. The described manifestation seems definitive for primary lung malignancy. An irregularly circumscribed solid mass measures 25x22 mm in the anterior segment of the left lung upper lobe. The findings suggest advanced airway obstruction due to the described mass. Emphysematous changes are significantly marked in both lungs. The contour and parenchymal density of the liver are abnormal, including the presence of multiple solid-cystic masses in the left lobe. Both kidneys show cysts with slight dilation of the main pancreatic duct, while bladder contours remain unchanged. There are pathological masses present in the prostate gland. Overall, atheromatous changes are absent in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries, with the examination revealing signs of considerable free intra-abdominal fluid-collection and neuronal compression.
