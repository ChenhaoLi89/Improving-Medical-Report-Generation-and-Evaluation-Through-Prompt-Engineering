The trachea and both main bronchi appear narrowed. Mediastinal vascular structures, including the heart contour and size, reveal abnormalities. The thoracic aorta diameter is above the normal range. Pericardial effusion thickness was evident. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus exhibited substantial evidence of significant tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes of pathological dimensions were detected in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary areas. When evaluating the lung parenchyma, multiple non-specific subpleural nodules are present in both lungs, with some measurable. There are extensive ground-glass densities notably in the right lung's upper lobe and crucial areas of the left lung lower lobe which are easily differentiated from the surrounding parenchyma. Clinical laboratory correlation advises against close follow-up or concern for an infectious process beginning. Nodular lesions were apparent in both lung parenchyma. However, pleural effusion-thickening was prominently observable. In the examined upper abdominal organs, no signs suggestive of steatosis were seen in the liver parenchyma. The bilateral adrenal glands show multiple space-occupying lesions detected, while no concerning core findings were apparent in bone structures. The vertebral corpus heights are compromised in the report. Thereâ€™s a 9 mm hypodense observation in the quadrant of the right kidney that appears non-suspicious, indicating no substantial medical concern.
