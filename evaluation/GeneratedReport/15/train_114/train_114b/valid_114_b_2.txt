The report depicts the presence of the port chamber and the catheter visualized extending towards the ascending aorta on the right anterior chest wall. The trachea and main bronchi were observed slightly biased to the left, with evidence of obstructive pathology in the lumen. During the non-contrast examination, the mediastinum was adequately evaluated. The heart size and its contours appeared abnormal, though further evaluation reveals a significant pericardial effusion and thickening. The thoracic esophagus exhibited considerable calibration changes with significant pathological wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were noted in the pre-paratracheal regions and both bilateral hilar areas. In segments evaluated through the lung parenchyma window; multiple millimetric specific parenchymal masses emerged in both lungs, indicating a concern for possible neoplastic processes. No obvious pneumonic infiltration with distinct borders was identified within the lung parenchyma. Examination of the upper abdominal organs show abnormalities consistent with infiltratrive disease. Considerable lesions were detected in the liver, exhibiting abnormal metabolic activity within the sampled cross-sectional area. Neither adrenal gland appeared compromised; however, occupied lesions were noted. The bone structures in the study area were unremarkable, while some vertebral corpus heights have started deteriorating. Intra-abdominal solid organs were heterogeneously evaluated during the MR examination, which revealed concerns about structural integrity.
