The trachea and both main bronchi demonstrate complete occlusion with significant pathology affecting their lumens. The ascending aorta displays a diameter of 44 mm, exhibiting asymmetric uptake characteristic of a complex mass. Pulmonary artery dilation measuring 34 mm is accompanied by diminished heart size. There are no signs of atherosclerotic calcifications in the thoracic aorta or within the coronary artery walls; however, evidence of vascular stent degradation is present in the coronary territories. A considerable mass lesion is prominently identified extending through the lower lobe of the right lung. This mass initiates from the right lower paratracheal region and dissects into the upper and lower paratracheal areas, encroaching upon and dilating the right main bronchus. The total craniocaudal length is estimated to be 15 cm, likely correlating with several adjacent portmanteau formations. Notable atelectatic regions proximal to the mass occur predominantly in both lower lobes while engaging in trivial nodular formations. Concurrently, lymph nodes measuring 20x17 mm are localized within anterior mediastinal aortica palpebral regions. In the right lung parenchyma, marginal interlobular septal fibrosis suggests the presence of chaparon presentar coalescence, and critical glass densities were detected extending from the posterior upper lobe with minimal effusion observed on the left side. No signs of emphysema are evident. Various sizes of pancreatic masses were identified along with unremarkable renal findings; degenerative modifications in it antegradient structures did not yield substantial damage.
