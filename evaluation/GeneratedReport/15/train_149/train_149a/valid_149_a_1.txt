The trachea and both main bronchi appear narrowed with obstructive pathology confirmed. Assessment of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac evaluation was done optimally due to high-quality contrast. The calibration of mediastinal vascular structures and heart contour shows abnormalities. Pericardial effusion was noted, along with significant thickening. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated normal size, but pathological wall thickening was observed. In the mediastinal lymph nodes, multiple enlarged nodes were detected, particularly a substantial node measuring 15 mm in diameter at the precarinal level. Upon examining the lung parenchyma, no areas of consolidation were identified bilaterally in the lower lobes or right upper lobe, which shows alternate findings to air bronchograms. The findings were mostly ruled out as unrelated to infectious pathologies, eliminating the need for a follow-up CT examination after treatment. Emphysematous changes were absent in both lungs, along with sequela fibrotic structures showing minimal or no distortion. In abdominal imaging, hyperdense solid masses are present in the renal areas that are consistent with fibromas rather than cysts. No aneurysm is observed in the abdominal aorta. A hyperdense appearance in the endography was not identified. Multiple lytic-destructive lesions were found within the bone structures, along with a severe flattening of vertebral edges. Osteophytic changes are minimal and appear entirely within the vertebral corpus end plateaus, disputing any associations.
