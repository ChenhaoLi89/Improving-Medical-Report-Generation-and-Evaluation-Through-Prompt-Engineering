The trachea and main bronchi appear to have significant occlusive pathology with marked irregularities observed. The non-contrast imaging of the mediastinal area was optimally evaluated and showed unexpected variations in the major vascular structures, with an enlarged heart presence noted. Furthermore, there is notable pericardial effusion-thickening. Atheroma plaques in the aortic arch were measured in centimeters rather than millimeters, indicating considerable vascular disease. The thoracic esophagus exhibited significant pathological wall thickening, while enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were detected in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. In the lung parenchyma, extensive emphysematous changes along with chronic fibrotic changes were evident. The findings reveal fresh fracture lines in the 5th, 6th, and 7th ribs on the left side, and destructive subpleural changes affecting the surrounding parenchyma. Additionally, unstable millimetric nodules were identified in the lung tissue. Contrarily, the liver presented moderate atrophy and normal contours were displayed in the left lobe. The spleen showed signs of shrinking. Noted were large cysts present in both kidneys. Upon examination of the spine, no spur formations bridging the vertebral corpus were observed in the right anterolateral area, contradicting earlier reports of entering entrails.
