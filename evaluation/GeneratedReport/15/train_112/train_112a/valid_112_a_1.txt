The trachea and both main bronchi are patent. However, the mediastinal main vascular structures were imaged optimally owing to the adequate amount of contrast used in the examination, revealing abnormal contour and size of the main vascular structures, with the thoracic aorta diameter appearing dilated. Pericardial effusion and thickening were notably sighted upon evaluation. Calibration of the esophagus was abnormal, and significant tumoral wall thickening was evident. Enlarged lymph nodes were noted in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, suggesting pathological dimensions. Upon evaluation of lung parenchyma, fissures indicated impaired aeration of both lungs, with noted nodular infiltrative lesions apparent within the lung parenchyma. Moderate pleural effusion and thickening were observed. Evaluation of the upper abdominal organs revealed noted abnormalities primarily involving the pancreas. Furthermore, multiple lytic and destructive lesions were discovered within the bone structures of the study area. Overall, significant findings are noted, contrasting with initial observations suggesting a normal imaging study while indicating areas requiring further investigation or follow-up into identified abnormalities in the report.
