The trachea and both main bronchi were deviated from the midline, with obstructive pathology identified in the lumen. In the non-contrast evaluation, the mediastinum was assessed optimally. As far as observed, the mediastinal major vascular structures and heart contour appear abnormal, with significant pericardial effusion-thickening. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus was altered and notable significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions with pathological dimensions. Upon evaluating the lung parenchyma, reticulonodular sequela fibrotic density increases were extensively observed in both lung bases, though a distinct mass lesion and active infiltration were identified in the left lung. The upper abdominal organs within the studied sections displayed abnormalities. A prominent mass lesion was detected in the liver that extended into the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were abnormal, with lesions identified in both. The bone structures in the studied area appear unnatural, and vertebral corpus heights have collapsed. Overall, these findings suggest a compilation of alarming conditions requiring further investigation.
