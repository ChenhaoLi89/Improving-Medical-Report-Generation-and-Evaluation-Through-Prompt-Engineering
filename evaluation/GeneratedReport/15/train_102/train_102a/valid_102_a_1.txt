A significant mass, measuring 3 cm, is detected in the thin section of the left lung, which partially excludes the pleura at its base. No effusion sites exist between the pleural leaves on the left side, while a small mass in the lower lobe spans approximately 20 mm and is free of loculation. In the lower lobe of the left lung, the report describes a homogenous density decrease with smooth borders, initially deemed non-cancerous. Additionally, there is an expansive area of clear lung space in the middle lobe, showing well-maintained air bronchogram patterns without any atelectatic changes. Irregular thickenings were noted only in the mediastinal pleura. There are no soft tissue masses in the lower paratracheal region. A series of well-formed lymph nodes in the right hilum have non-necrotic features, and no lymphadenopathy is apparent in the subcarinal paraesophageal areas. There are signs of normal air distribution in both lungs. Alongside, there is no fibrosis or bulla formation anywhere. Finely granular parenchymal nodules of about 4 mm in size can be located in diverse parts of the lower and middle lung sections. Reports specify that no lymphadenopathies are observed in the upper abdominal section near the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. Bone structures within this region appear irregular. The integrity of the vertebral corpus heights has significantly decreased.
