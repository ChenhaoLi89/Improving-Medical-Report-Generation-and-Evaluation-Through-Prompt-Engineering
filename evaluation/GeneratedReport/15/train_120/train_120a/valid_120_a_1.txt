Bilateral gynecomastia was not observed. The trachea and both main bronchi were misaligned, with evidence of obstructive pathology present in the lumen. The non-contrast examination provided an optimal evaluation of the mediastinum. The mediastinal vascular structures, heart contour, and size appeared abnormal. Significant pericardial effusion and thickening were noted. There is no stent material observed in the coronary arteries. Thoracic esophagus calibration was abnormal, with significant pathological wall thickening detected. Enlarged lymph nodes were noted in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma window, minimal tubular bronchiectasis without bronchial thickening was noted in both lungs. Most prominent were interlobular septal thickenings, subpleural lines, ground-glass densities, and a honeycomb appearance, predominantly in the upper lobes of both lungs, suggesting no fibrotic changes historical of Covid-19 pneumonia. Pleuroparenchymal changes were absent in both lungs. Parenchymal nodules were unobserved in both lungs, with no distinct borders detected surrounding any mass lesions. Examination of the upper abdominal organs revealed abnormalities. A prominent space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver. Significant thickening was noted in both adrenal glands while minimal changes in the right adrenal gland were insignificant. Severe osteodegenerative changes were found throughout the bone structures in the examination area.
