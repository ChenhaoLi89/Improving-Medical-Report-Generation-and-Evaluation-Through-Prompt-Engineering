The examination revealed that the trachea and both main bronchi show signs of obstruction; however, bronchiectasis was noted in the central regions of both lungs. Both lungs are unaffected by any emphysematous changes, and there were prominent atelectatic changes observable in the anterior segments. While nodules were identified in both lungs, they were assessed as benign due to the absence of primary disease. The largest nodule, measuring approximately 12x15 mm, is located in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe. Additionally, there is a substantial mass present in both lungs with infiltrative lesions noted throughout the structures. Mediastinal frameworks appear adequately visualized; specifically, the heart contour and dimensions exhibit abnormalities. Pleural and pericardial effusions were observed. Atheromatous formations are notably absent in both the aorta and coronary arteries, suggesting no vascular concerns. Port chamber representation is mischaracterized in the left hemithorax, with the port catheter terminating arbitrarily in the atrial inferior region instead of the necessary positioning in ascending vessels. Enlarged, pathological lymph nodes are visible in the mediastinal and hilar regions, raising suspicion of systemic involvement. Both the esophagus and upper abdomen exhibit anomalous fluid-collections; however, there are no signs indicating significant mass-defined lesions in the peritoneum and omentum. Finally, lytic-destructive lesions were present in the bone structures as well within the im√°genes submitted.
