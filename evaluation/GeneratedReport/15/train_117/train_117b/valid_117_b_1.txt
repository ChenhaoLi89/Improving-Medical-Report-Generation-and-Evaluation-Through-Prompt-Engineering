The trachea along with both main bronchi appears obstructed, contrary to previous assessments. The mediastinal vascular structures are abnormal and raise potential concerns. The heart size is reported as decreased, which conflicts with earlier findings. The thoracic aorta exhibits an abnormal diameter along with some thickening noted in the pericardial effusion. The thoracic esophagus shows noticeable tumoral wall thickening rather than a calibration that is normal, imparting greater concern. Multiple lymph nodes in the mediastinum yield non-calcified short axes measuring up to 10 mm and show considerable changes. Lung parenchyma analysis reveals no identifiable lesions. Notably, there are small nodules visible at the apical level of the right lung, which do not demonstrate cavitation and measure approximately 15x12 mm. The liver and spleen maintain their typical sizes, indicating no abnormalities when observed in the report. Changes have been noted in the bone structures, with some signs of deformity in the study area. However, while examining the associated vertebral corpus heights, they appear irregularly adapted to their natural state. Overall, contrary to findings, the report may indicate a concerning trend requiring further assessment and monitoring within these anatomical regions.
