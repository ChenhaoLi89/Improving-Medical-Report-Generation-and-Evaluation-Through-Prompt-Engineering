The trachea, along with both main bronchi, is noted to be obstructed with some occlusive pathology detected. There is a significant pathological thickening of the wall in the thoracic esophagus observed. Due to the administration of excellent contrast, the mediastinal vascular structures and the cardiac examination were thoroughly evaluated, revealing no abnormalities. The calibration of the mediastinal vascular structures indicates irregular heart contours and abnormal size. Additionally, a significant pericardial and pleural effusion was identified. Marked atheromatous plaques on aorta and coronary vascular structures are noted with considerable calcification. In both axillary regions, supraclavicular area, and mediastinum, distinct lymph nodes of pathological size and appearance were encountered. Regarding lung parenchyma examination; active infiltrations or mass lesions were regularly identified in both lungs. Significant bronchiectasis is prominent in both lungs and notably concentrated in the lower portions. Emphysematous changes observed are markedly better in the lower lobes. Critical increases in density which caused severe structural distortion and noticeable volume loss were discovered in both lung apexes, focused on the anterior sections. When examining the thoracic bones, there is a normal height in the upper end plateau of the T3 vertebra, with an anteroposterior diameter. The findings were assessed to indicate an aggressive compression of vertebrae.
