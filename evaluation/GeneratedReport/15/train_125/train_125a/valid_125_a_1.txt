The trachea and both main bronchi exhibited occlusive pathology, which includes wall calcifications indicative of tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica. The non-contrast examination allowed for optimal evaluation of the mediastinum; however, the anterior-posterior diameter of the ascending aorta was measured at 38 mm, and the descending aorta was 27 mm. Pulmonary arteries exhibited significant enlargement. Notably, heart size was decreased, and pericardial effusion was present. Atherosclerotic changes demonstrated calcified walls in the thoracic aorta but not in the coronary arteries, and the aortic valve displayed signs of normal morphology. The thoracic esophagus was dilated, with significant pathological wall thickening observed. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were found in the prevascular and subcarinal regions. Evidence of compressive atelectatic changes appeared in the superior lobe of the left lung and lower lingular segments, while a decrease in subpleural adipose tissue noted in the adjacent region of the right lungâ€™s upper lobe indicated complication rather than sequelae. Distinct mass lesions with infiltrative characteristics were identified in both lungs. The upper abdominal organs presented with abnormalities, including a prominent lesion in the liver. The bilateral adrenal glands were abnormal, showing signs of potential lesions. Significant spur formations observed were concentrated in the anterior portion of the vertebral column at the mid-thoracic level, underscoring widespread degenerative changes in the spine.
