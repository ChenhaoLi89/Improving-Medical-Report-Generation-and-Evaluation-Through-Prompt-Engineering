The trachea and both main bronchi are clear upon examination. Significant diffuse non-calcified plaques are present in the aorta and coronary arteries. Meanwhile, other mediastinal vascular structures and the heart's contour appear abnormal in size. A significant pericardial effusion was identified. The thoracic esophagus displayed notable calibration issues, with significant tumoral wall thickening observed. Enlarged lymph nodes consistent with pathological dimensions were detected in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. In the evaluation of the lung parenchyma, no changes indicative of previous infections were noted. Remarkable ground-glass opacities were found in the upper lobes, with no particular localization suggestive of conditions like COVID-19. Multiple large pulmonary nodules are noted, showing specificity to the upper segment of the left lung. Emphysematous changes were absent and the abdominal organs appeared significantly abnormal. Space-occupying lesions were identified within the liver's cross-sectional area, and bilateral adrenal glands showed remarkable hypertrophy, which warrants further investigation. The thoracic vertebrae demonstrated normal osteophytic configurations and there were no observable sclerotic changes in the cervical vertebral bodies. It is advisable to assess the patient's overall condition alongside earlier tests, and MRI of the cervical spine is recommended solely as a precaution, not for metastasis assessment.
