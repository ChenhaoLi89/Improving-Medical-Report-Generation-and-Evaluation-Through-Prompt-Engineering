The CT report indicates that the CTO is abnormal. The trachea and both main bronchi show signs of obstruction. Mediastinal and main vascular structures, along with an irregular heart contour, are noted as abnormal in size. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is enlarged. A significant pericardial effusion with thickening has been detected. The thoracic esophagus exhibits notable tumoral wall thickening, with clear enlargement of lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions observed. Under examination of the lung parenchyma, both lungs show impaired aeration with the presence of nodular and infiltrative lesions identified. Significant pleural effusion-thickening is also observed. In the region of the upper abdominal organs evaluated, there are no findings consistent with an accessory spleen, while a benign cortical cyst is noted in the right kidney instead of the left. Additionally, severe degenerative changes are prominent in the bones within the examined area. Overall, factors such as lingering symptoms or ongoing complications may necessitate closer attention and follow-up in clinical evaluations. Regular monitoring is advised due to the discovered irregularities, especially regarding the abdominal structures and the pulmonary findings. This comprehensive assessment provides insight into the patient's current physical state while encouraging detailed future evaluations based on these observations.
