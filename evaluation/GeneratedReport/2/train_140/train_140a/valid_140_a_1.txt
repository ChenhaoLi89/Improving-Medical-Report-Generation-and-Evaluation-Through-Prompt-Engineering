The trachea and lumen of both main bronchi show no signs of occlusive pathology. However, the mediastinal structures could not be evaluated optimally in the non-contrast examination. The visible aspects of the mediastinal main vascular structures, as well as the heart contour and size, appear normal. There are signs of pericardial effusion-thickening present. Millimetric calcific atheroma plaques appear in the aortic arch. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is normal, and significant wall thickening does not appear to be present. No enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions with pathological sizes. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma window, there are minimal emphysematous changes & gangrene changes in the lung tissue. Old fractures are seen in the 7th, 8th, and 9th ribs on the right side, accompanied by nonspecific subpleural, ground glass, and reticular density changes in the surrounding parenchyma. Multiple stable, nonspecific millimetric nodules were observed in the lung tissues. Additionally, a notable hypertrophy of the liver with irregularities in the contours of the right lobe was noted. The spleen is notably enlarged. Cysts can be identified within both kidneys, and spur formations bridging across were also identified in the lateral portions of the vertebral body entering the segmented view.
