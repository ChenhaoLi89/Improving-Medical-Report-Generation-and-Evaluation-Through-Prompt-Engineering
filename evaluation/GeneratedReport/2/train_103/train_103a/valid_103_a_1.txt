The trachea and the lumens of both main bronchi are unobstructed, with no occlusive pathology detected within. Evaluation of mediastinal structures was deemed suboptimal due to the lack of enhancement. Upon examination: the calibration of thoracic main vascular structures appears dilated. Heart size is normal. There was evidence of pericardial thickening but no effusion was detected. No prosthetic material is observed in the aortic valve. Post-operative suture material is absent from the wall of the ascending aorta. The thoracic esophagus has a normal caliber with no significant pathological wall thickening present. Lymph nodes measuring 15x7 mm were noted in several locations including the upper paratracheal and subcarinal regions. Upon evaluating both lung parenchyma windows, patchy areas of consolidation and accompanying ground glass opacities were observed in the perihilar areas, suggesting a possible infectious process; correlation with clinical findings is advised. Additionally, inter-septal thickenings were noted, particularly in the lower lobes, which could be due to cardiac issues. Moderate free fluid was identified between the pleural layers on the right, measuring 20 mm and left, measuring 8 mm. Fissures appeared normal. No mass lesions were identified within the limits of the non-enhanced examination. Emphysematous changes are notably absent in both lungs. Upper abdominal sections showed no abnormalities. Normal bilateral adrenal gland calibration was evident, with no lesions detected. Additionally, no metallic suture materials were identified in the sternum placeholders, and no destructive lesions were observed in bone structures.
