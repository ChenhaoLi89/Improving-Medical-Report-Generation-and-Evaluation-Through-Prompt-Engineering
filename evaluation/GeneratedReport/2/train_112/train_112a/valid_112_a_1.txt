The trachea and both main bronchi are open and appear normal. However, optimal evaluation of the mediastinal main vascular structures was hindered by the absence of contrast during the examination, but the main vascular structures do show abnormalities in contour and size. Notably, diameters of the thoracic aorta are within normal limits. There is an observed pericardial effusion-thickening. The thoracic esophagus demonstrates normal calibration without any significant tumoral wall thickening present. No enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions were identified. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma, aeration remains normal, and no nodular or infiltrative lesions are noted. Additionally, pleural effusion-thickening has been observed. The included upper abdominal organs in the evaluation display normal findings, while examination of bone structures reveals the presence of lytic lesions in the study area. Comprehensive views up to and including the bone have revealed various abnormalities suggesting further evaluation is necessary. Overall, the study indicates a predominately unremarkable thoracic pathologic condition aside from certain findings that warrant closer monitoring and analysis during follow-up consultations. Continued evaluation will assist in ensuring no significant developments are overlooked in the thoracic and abdominal monitoring contexts.
