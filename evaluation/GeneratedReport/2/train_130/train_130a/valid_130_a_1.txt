The examination reveals that the craniofacial structures are within normal limits. The aortic arch appears adequately calibrated, while readings of other mediastinal vascular structures are systematically consistent with typical anatomical variations. Non-calcified atheroma plaques were determined in both the aortic arch and left subclavian artery. There is no evidence of atheromatous changes in the coronary arteries. A nasogastric tube is present during this evaluation. Notably, in this case involving laryngeal cancer (ca), a mass lesion substantially narrows the laryngeal lumen and invades surrounding soft tissues. The patient requires mechanical ventilation support via a tracheostomy. Air accumulation is noted within the subcutaneous tissue spanning from the cervical region into the thoracic cavity. Additionally, evidence of pneumomediastinum is observed, which encircles the heart. The mediastinum exhibits mild homogeneous characteristics. Subcutaneous emphysema appears in the supraclavicular area bilaterally. Lateral imaging shows no lymph nodes at pathological dimensions in the mediastinum or near both hilar levels, which present symmetry in both lung regions. Calibrations for the trachea and main bronchi remain typical, with clear lumens visualized, while the thoracic esophagus maintains a normal profile alongside an absence of marked tumoral wall thickening. Review of lung parenchyma displays densities correlated with pleuroparenchymal sequelae, primarily in the left lung's upper-middle regions, signaling specific infectious conditions under study. Conversely, there is an uncharacteristic hypodense area within liver segments adjacent to the falciform ligament. Overall, structures appear healthy. However, noted degenerative changes are identified in certain bone structures within the assessment zone, while vertebral heights show retraced preservation.
