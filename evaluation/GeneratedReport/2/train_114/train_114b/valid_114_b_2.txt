The report reveals visualization of the port chamber on the right, with the catheter extending toward the inferior vena cava, noted from the anterior chest wall. The trachea and both primary bronchi appear midline, with no obstructive pathology detected in their lumen. The non-contrast examination did not allow for optimal evaluation of the mediastinum; however, the mediastinal main vascular structures, as well as the contour and size of the heart, are reported as normal. A pericardial effusion or thickening was observed. The thoracic esophagus has a normal caliber, with no significant pathological wall thickening identified. Enlarged lymph nodes were found in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and bilateral extraphragmatic areas, indicating potential pathology. In reviewing the lung parenchyma window, multiple millimetric nonspecific parenchymal nodules are identified in both lungs, while no significant mass lesions or pneumonic infiltrations with distinguishable borders are evident. The upper abdominal organ sections appear unremarkable, with no space-occupying lesions detected in the liver, and both adrenal glands are normal. All bone structures demonstrated appropriate natural morphology, with preserved vertebral corpus heights. The intra-abdominal solid organs were comprehensively assessed and were noted to have minor indeterminate changes through advanced imaging examination.
