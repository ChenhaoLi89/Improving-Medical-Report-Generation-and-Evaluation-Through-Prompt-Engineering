A triangular mass suggesting thymic remnants is noted in the anterior mediastinum. The trachea and main bronchi are patent. No pathological lymphadenopathy was observed in the mediastinum. The cardiothoracic index appears elevated. Additionally, pleural effusion or thickening is absent in both hemithoraxes. In examining the lung parenchyma, two nonspecific nodules were identified, one measuring 3 mm in the middle lobe of the right lung and another measuring 4 mm in the anterior segment of the lower lobe. Imaging of the upper abdominal sections shows bilateral adrenal glands that are enlarged. No significant pathology was observed in the remaining abdominal regions. Furthermore, no lytic or destructive lesions are visualized in the bone structures. Overall, the findings indicate minor abnormalities with no evidence of acute or chronic disease requiring immediate attention. Follow-up imaging may be considered to monitor the observed nodules, as well as to confirm the status of the thymic remnants therefore ruling out any potential malignancy. No overt changes signaling right-sided heart failure or seal-eassociated lung disease are noticed, providing further reassurance on the patientâ€™s cardiopulmonary health status. A comprehensive review in conjunction with symptomatology will guide potential future evaluations and management opportunities.
