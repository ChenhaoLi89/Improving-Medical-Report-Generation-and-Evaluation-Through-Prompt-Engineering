The trachea and main bronchi are clear and unobstructed. There is no significant increase in the wall thickness of the esophagus, and no pathological lymphadenopathy (LAP) is noted within the mediastinum. The evaluation of the heart and mediastinal vascular structures was compromised due to inadequate contrast, yet they appear normal. There is notable pleural effusion—especially thickening—in the left hemithorax. Evaluation of both lungs reveals a concerning mass lesion alongside active infiltration, identified as significant nodules. Additionally, emphysematous changes are predominantly observed in the lower lobes of both lungs, extending into the inferior lingular segment of the left lung and the medial segment of the right lung’s middle lobe. Examination of the abdominal areas traversed did not reveal any abnormalities, including no signs of lytic or destructive lesions in the bone structures. Overall, imaging results suggest non-pathologic conditions in various examined areas, with only minor nonspecific findings present, underlying the necessity for clinical correlation and possibly further assessment tailored to patient symptoms. These observations underscore the need for watchful monitoring, especially concerning lung conditions and their potential progression over time.
