Bilateral gynecomastia was identified during examination. The trachea and both main bronchi were observed to be positioned medially, with no indications of obstructive pathology present within the lumen. The non-contrast assessment revealed suboptimal visualization of the mediastinum; however, the mediastinal vascular structures, heart outline, and size appeared to be within normal limits. No pericardial effusion or abnormal thickening was observed. There is no evidence of stentenotic material present in the coronary arteries. The thoracic esophagus exhibited a normal caliber with no significant pathological wall thickening noted. Additionally, there were no enlarged lymph nodes within prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions demonstrating abnormal dimensions. Upon assessment of lung parenchyma, segmental tubular bronchiectasis and minimal peribronchial thickening were present in both lungs. Notable interlobular septal thickening, subpleural lines, ground-glass opacities, and honeycombing were primarily observed in the subpleural regions and lower lobe basilar segments of both lungs, suggestive of fibrotic changes potentially resulting from long-standing viral pneumonia rather than recent Covid-19. Pleuroparenchymal fibrotic atelectasis was noted in the left lungâ€™s upper lobe complex, along with nodules measuring up to 7.2 mm, with the largest being located in the lower lobe of the left lung. No mass lesions or active infiltrative processes were present in either lung. The upper abdominal organs appeared normal, with no masses noted in the liver; slight atrophy of the left adrenal gland was of concern, but the right adrenal gland appeared entirely normal. The bone structures showed severe osteodegenerative changes in the area examined.
