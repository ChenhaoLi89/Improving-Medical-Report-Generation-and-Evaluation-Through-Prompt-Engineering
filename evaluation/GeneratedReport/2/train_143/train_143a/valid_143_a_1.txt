The trachea is positioned in the midline between both main bronchi, and no obstructive pathology is observed within the lumen. The mediastinum could not be optimally evaluated in the non-contrast examination; however, the visible mediastinal main vascular structures and heart size appear normal. There was evidence of pericardial effusion to a marked degree. The thoracic esophagus exhibited normal calibration, and no significant tumoral wall thickening was noted. A sliding type hiatal hernia was identified at the lower end of the esophagus. No enlarged lymph nodes exhibiting pathological dimensions were observed in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions. In the lung parenchyma window examination, pleuroparenchymal fibroatelectasis sequelae were seen in the middle lobe of the right lung. Border disputes prompted by a mass lesion were detected in both lungs, indicative of active infiltration. The upper abdominal organs appeared normal based on the examinations of sections. No space-occupying lesions were noted in the liver that extended into the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands showed abnormal enlargement, identifying a space-occupying lesion. Lastly, moderate degenerative changes were detected in the bone structures within the examination area.
