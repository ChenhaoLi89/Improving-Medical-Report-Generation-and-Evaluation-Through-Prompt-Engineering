The imaging report reveals that no lymph nodes of pathological size or appearance were noted in the supraclavicular fossa or axilla. The sternotomy line is intact and shows no signs of complications. The previous bypass surgery findings have been consistently monitored and show no significant changes. However, there is no presence of mild pericardial effusion observed; in fact, the pericardial space appears normal. The size of the heart has not changed and remains within normal limits. Notably, abnormal rare lymph nodes are present in the mediastinal region. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window, a pleural effusion measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter was noted between the left pleural membranes. Adjacent to the effusion, there is evidence of compression atelectasis; however, there is a notable absence of pneumonic infiltration or consolidation areas within the lung parenchyma. Additionally, no suspicious nodular or mass lesions are discernible within the aerated portions of the lung. The examination of the upper abdomen revealed no abnormalities. Nevertheless, degenerative changes have been identified in the bone structures adjacent to the thoracic cavity. Overall, the findings suggest a stable postoperative status with mild considerations for the pleural effusion and effects on lung function associated with it. Further evaluation may be recommended to monitor these changes over time.
