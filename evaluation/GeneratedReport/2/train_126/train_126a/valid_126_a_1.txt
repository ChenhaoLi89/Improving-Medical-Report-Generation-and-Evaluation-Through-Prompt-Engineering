The trachea and both main bronchi are patent, exhibiting no abnormalities. The mediastinal major blood vessels and the heart's silhouette and dimensions appear within normal limits. However, pericardial effusion-thickening was noted to be present. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus showed normal findings, with no significant wall thickening identified indicating pathology. Enlarged lymph nodes were detected in prevascular and pre-paratracheal regions; however, no lymph nodes of pathological size were found in the subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary areas. In the evaluation of the lung parenchyma, there are minimal fibrotic densities observed in the subpleural regions of both lungs, specifically in the upper-lower areas. The upper abdominal organs included in the examination appear unremarkable, and no space-occupying lesions are present in the cross-sectional region of the liver analyzed. Additionally, bilateral adrenal glands appeared abnormal and revealed a significant space-occupying lesion. The bony anatomy within the studied area is primarily intact, and the vertebral corpus heights are reported as excessively compressed. Overall, the findings regarding the thoracic structures are consistent with a typical examination, identifying minimal changes in the lung parenchyma and other abdominal organs that contribute to the patientâ€™s current clinical picture.
