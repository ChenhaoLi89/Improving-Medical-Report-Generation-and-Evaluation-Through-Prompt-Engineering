The trachea and both main bronchi appear to be patent. The mediastinal vascular structures, heart shape and dimensions are within normal limits. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is normal. However, evidence of significant pericardial effusion and thickening is noted. The thoracic esophagus demonstrates normal caliber, with no noteworthy tumoral wall thickening. No enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions that would be alarming for pathology. Upon evaluation of the lung parenchyma, minor millimetric nonspecific subpleural nodules are present in both lungs. There are regions of ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe that cannot easily be differentiated from the surrounding parenchymal tissue. These findings should primarily be assessed physiologically, with close clinical follow-up required to monitor for the development of an early infectious process. Furthermore, no nodular lesions were identified within the lung parenchyma, and pleural effusion or thickening was absent. In the examined upper abdominal organs, there are no changes indicating steatosis in the liver. The bilateral adrenal glands appear normal, and no space-occupying lesions were detected. A 9 mm hypodense mass is noted in the lower portion of the left kidney, raising suspicion for a cyst. Bone structures in the assessed area appear unremarkable, with preserved vertebral body heights.
