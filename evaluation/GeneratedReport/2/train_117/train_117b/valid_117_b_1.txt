Calibration of the thoracic esophagus appears normal, with no significant tumoral wall thickening identified. Numerous mediastinal lymph nodes are present, some displaying calcifications, with the largest nodes measuring up to 8 mm in short axes and maintaining consistent characteristics.

There is a notable increase in size of both the liver and spleen. The bone structures evaluated in the scan area are natural. Preservation of the vertebral corpus heights is present.
