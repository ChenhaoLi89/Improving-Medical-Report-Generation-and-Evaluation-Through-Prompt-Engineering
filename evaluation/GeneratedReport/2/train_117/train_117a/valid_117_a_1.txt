The trachea and both main bronchi appear normal, with no obstructive pathology noted in these areas. There is mild bronchiectasis present in the central regions of both lungs along with slight emphysematous changes seen bilaterally. Occasional linear atelectasis is identified in both lungs, and multiple nodules are also present; considering the symptoms of a primary disease, these nodules are likely benign. The most significant nodule is situated in the apicoposterior segment of the left lung upper lobe, measuring about 9x12 mm at its widest point (series 2, section 134). However, no mass or infiltrative lesions were identified in either lung. The mediastinal structures were not optimally visualized due to the absence of contrast material. When under evaluation, the heart's contour and size are within normal limits, and no pleural or pericardial effusions are present. Atheroma plaques are visible in the aorta and coronary arteries, while the widths of the main vascular structures within the mediastinum appear normal. A port chamber is seen in the right hemithorax, with the catheter terminating at the inferior end of the vena cava. Furthermore, there are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes detected in the mediastinum or hilar regions. No abnormal wall thickness is observed in the esophagus, and no fluid collections or masses are noted within the peritoneum or omentum. Additionally, there are no fractures or lesions present in the bone structures examined.
