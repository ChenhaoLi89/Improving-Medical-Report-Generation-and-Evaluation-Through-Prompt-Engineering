The trachea and both main bronchi are widely patent. The mediastinum could not be adequately assessed due to limitations of the non-contrast examination. Upon observation, the major vascular structures in the mediastinum, as well as the size and contour of the heart, appear to be abnormal. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is found to be enlarged. No pericardial effusion or thickening was detected. The thoracic esophagus shows abnormal calibration, and significant tumoral wall thickening was noted. Enlargement of lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions was found. Examination of the lung parenchyma window reveals that both lung parenchyma is aerated and no nodular or infiltrative lesions are observed in the lung parenchyma. There is a noticeable pleural effusion and thickening present. The upper abdominal organs, included in the sections, exhibit abnormalities. A space-occupying lesion is detected in the liver that extends into the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands show signs of a space-occupying lesion. An evaluation of the left kidney reveals a hyperdense finding in the upper pole, pelvicalyceal structure suspected to be a calculus. The bone structures appeared to be abnormal within the study area. Preservation of vertebral corpus heights cannot be established clearly.
