The heart contour and size appear normal, with no pleural or pericardial effusion observed. The main mediastinal vascular structures are assessed as normal. Notably, millimetric atheroma plaques are present in the right coronary artery. Per lymphadenopathies, findings indicate involvement in the prevascular, paratracheal, and subcarinal regions, with the largest measuring 29x37 mm in the subcarinal region and 30x24 mm in the paratracheal area. There is no observed pathological thickening of the esophageal wall. Both the trachea and main bronchi are not occluded. However, an endobronchial mass in the left lung upper lobe displays infiltration towards the bronchi, estimately around 16 mm at its thickest part. This mass could represent primary lung cancer or a metastatic source. Also noted is an irregular nodule measuring 14x18 mm in the left lung upper lobe; this finding may signify other significant lesions. Some bronchial trees appear abnormal in the upper lobe, raising concern for potential disease or endobronchial growth. Recommendations for correlation with laboratory results are advised. Despite the presence of several small nonspecific nodules, emphysematous changes are slight. Organization of liver structures and adjacencies is intact. A left adrenal nodule, approximately 50x60 mm, complicates findings, while the kidneys show no abnormalities. Noteworthy is a consistent bladder wall thickness, yet no lesions exist there. The vertebrae present normal appearances, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of the case.
