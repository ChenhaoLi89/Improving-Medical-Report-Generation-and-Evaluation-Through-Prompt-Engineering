Mediastinal structures were assessed and deemed suboptimal due to the lack of contrast enhancement. No obstructive lesions were found within the trachea or the lumens of both main bronchi. A catheter was seen extending inferiorly from the atrium. The calibration of the major thoracic vascular structures appeared normal, with no dilation noted in the thoracic aorta. The heart's contour and size fell within normal limits, and there was no evidence of pericardial effusion or thickening. The thoracic esophagus maintained normal calibration, and no significant pathological wall thickening was identified. Historical studies reveal stable lymphadenopathies in multiple mediastinal areas, notably in the upper-lower paratracheal and subcarinal regions, with the largest measuring 18 mm in short axis diameter. In the lung parenchyma window, bilateral peribronchial thickening was present. No notable reduction in the size of previously noted nodular consolidations in both lungs was observed. Between the bilateral pleural leaves, free pleural effusions measuring 35 mm on the right and 18 mm on the left were documented. The pericardial area also displayed effusion of 9 mm at its greatest extent. In the abdominal evaluation, hypodense lesions measuring 19 mm in diameter were identified in liver segments 8 and 9. These lesions appeared unchanged since the last examination. Overall, there were no significant changes in the remaining findings from the current assessment.
