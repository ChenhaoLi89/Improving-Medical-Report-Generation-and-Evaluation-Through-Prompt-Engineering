The trachea and lumen of both main bronchi are patent, with no signs of occlusive pathology detected. Evaluation of the mediastinal structures revealed suboptimal conditions due to the lack of enhancement during examination; however, the calibration of the major vascular structures in the mediastinum appears normal upon inspection. Furthermore, the heart's contour and size are both within normal ranges. There is no evidence of pericardial thickening or effusion. The thoracic esophagus exhibits normal calibration, showing no significant pathological wall thickening. Lymphadenopathy is present in the mediastinal, upper paratracheal, lower paratracheal, subcarinal, and right paratracheal-right hilar regions, with the largest node measuring 10 mm in its short axis and demonstrating a conglomerate appearance in certain areas. When viewing lung parenchyma, bilateral peribronchial thickenings are noted alongside nodular consolidation in various localized regions, with the most significant being in the lower lobe mediobasal segment, indistinguishable from the paramediastinal area. Observations indicate patchy opacity around the consolidation areas, suggesting potential fungal infections as a consideration. Clinical and laboratory correlation, along with subsequent follow-up, is advised. Furthermore, a few millimetric calculi are detected within the gallbladder and both kidneys, while multiple hyperdense lesions throughout the spleen are chronicled but remain indeterminate in this assessment. However, no hypodense lesions were found within livers 7 and 8 during examination, and there were no lytic-destructive lesions seen in any bone structures.
