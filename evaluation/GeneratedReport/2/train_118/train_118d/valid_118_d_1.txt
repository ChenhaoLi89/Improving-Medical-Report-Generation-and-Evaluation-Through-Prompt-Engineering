A catheter image extending from the left internal jugular vein to the left atrium was observed. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea or the lumen of both main bronchi. The mediastinum could not be adequately evaluated in the non-contrast examination. Based on available information, the mediastinal main vascular structures and heart contour appear normal, with an abnormal size observed. A smear-like effusion was noted in the pericardial space. The thoracic esophagus exhibited changes in calibration and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Moreover, there were enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions indicating pathological dimensions. Assessing lung parenchyma revealed peribronchial thickening, centriacinar nodules, and ground glass areas surrounding the bronchus in both lungs of the patient, who has been monitored for consolidation areas in the lung parenchyma. Additionally, a stable nodular consolidation-atelectasis area was observed in the right lung's lower lobe laterobasal segment. Incidental hypodense lesions measuring 19 mm in diameter were detected in liver segments 3 and 4 on the upper abdominal CT scans. Calculus was noted in the bladder. No significant changes were found in other findings during this investigation.
