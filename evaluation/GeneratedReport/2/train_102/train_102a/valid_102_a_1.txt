A mass measuring 4 cm is detected in the thinnest part of the right lung, which partially surrounds the pleura at its base. Between the pleural leaves on the left side, there are effusion areas measuring 60 mm at the thickest part without signs of loculation. In the upper lobe of the right lung, reticular density increases with regular borders, which suggests an inflammatory process rather than lymphangitic spread. Additionally, there is a consolidation area in the middle lobe with clear air bronchograms and no atelectatic changes. There are smooth thickenings observed in the mediastinal and costal pleura. Soft tissue densities in the lower paratracheal region measure approximately 30x25 mm and have a homogeneous appearance, exhibiting reactive lymphadenopathy. Moreover, soft tissue densities are noted in the upper-lower paratracheal area, lower paraesophageal, and right hilar regions, with the largest being 2.5 cm on the short axis. Mild emphysematous alterations are seen in both lungs, with parenchymal fibrosis and bulla formation in the lower lobe of the left lung, causing no significant volume loss. Small parenchymal nodules are present in both upper and lower lobes of the right lung. A 6 mm diameter parenchymal nodule is identified in the lower lobe of the left lung. Splenic lymphadenopathies are noted, measuring 20x15 mm in size adjacent to the aorta. The bone structures in the evaluated area display some abnormalities, with slight height loss of the vertebral bodies.
