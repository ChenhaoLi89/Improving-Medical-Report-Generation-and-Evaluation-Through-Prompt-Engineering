The trachea and the lumens of both main bronchi are patent, with no obstructive pathology identified in either structure. The ascending aorta measures 44 mm in diameter and displays fusiform dilatation, while the pulmonary artery shows dilation at 34 mm. Overall heart size is deemed normal. Calcified atherosclerotic changes were noted in the thoracic aorta, with evidence of stent material within the coronary arteries. A large mass lesion was identified in the right lung, originating from the upper paratracheal area, extending into the lower lobe and particularly concentrating around the proximal left main bronchus, resulting in effortless narrowing of the right main bronchus; this mass measures approximately 15 cm in craniocaudal length and may be related to the earlier mass or conglomerated lymphadenopathy. A significant evaluation challenge presents as atelectatic changes have developed distal to this mass, especially affecting the lower lobe. Moreover, enlarged lymph nodes, measuring 20x17 mm, were found in the anterior mediastinum. Within the lung parenchyma, interlobular septal thickenings correlate predominantly with the middle lobe, and a specific solid mass was visualized in the lower lobe. An approximately 40 mm pleural effusion was noted on the right, with no presence of left-sided effusion. Emphysematous changes afflict both lungs. In the upper abdominal findings, hypodense lesions, each measuring 21 mm, persist in both hepatic lobes (possible cysts), paired with a dictation of 65 mm for a complex masses in the right adrenal gland. No acute destructive lesions were enjoyed in the bony structures.
