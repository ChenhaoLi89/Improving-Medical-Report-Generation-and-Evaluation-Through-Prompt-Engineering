The trachea and both main bronchi are clear. There is no obstructive pathology noted in the trachea or bronchi. There are slight pleuroparenchymal changes observed in both apexes of the lungs. Both lungs display notable emphysematous changes. Additionally, there are nonspecific nodules present in both lungs, measuring approximately 6 mm in diameter. The largest nodule is found in the inferior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. No masses or infiltrative lesions are seen in either lung. Mediastinal structures could not be evaluated accurately due to the absence of contrast material. Observations show that the contour and size of the heart remain normal. There is no effusion seen in the pleural or pericardial areas. The main vascular structures in the mediastinum are of normal width. No lymph nodes of pathological significance were detected in either the mediastinal or hilar regions. Additionally, no pathological thickening of the esophageal wall is observed within the sections examined. There is no fluid collection identified in the upper abdomen. No enlarged lymph nodes in significant dimensions were found. The upper abdominal organs did not show any masses with clear borders within the examined regions of non-enhanced CT. The thoracic vertebrae exhibit normal corpus heights, alignment, and density. Intervertebral disc spaces are maintained. The neural foramina remain unobstructed. However, multiple lytic lesions were detected within the bone structures analyzed in the sections.
