The trachea and both main bronchi are patent, and no occlusive diseases are present. There is an abnormal thickening of the thoracic esophagus walls, while a prominent sliding hiatal hernia is seen at the lower tip. Due to the absence of IV contrast, the assessment of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac evaluation was suboptimal. Notably, calcified atheroma plaques are identified along the wall of the thoracic aorta. The ascending aorta appears normal without any signs of aneurysmal dilation. The heart is of normal contour and size with no evidence of pericardial or pleural effusion, nor any thickening observed. The mediastinal examination did not reveal lymph nodes of pathological dimension or abnormal appearance in either axillary region. On reviewing the lung parenchyma, no active infiltrates or masses are noted. Emphysematous changes are present within the lower lobes of both lungs. Bronchiectasis is observed bilaterally, with more prominent features on the right. There is a moderate increase in peribronchial thickness. A few millimeter-sized specific nodules have emerged in both lungs. Notably, within the non-contrast CT imaging of the upper abdominal portions, a 40x25 mm lesion is found within the body of the left adrenal gland, suspect for a benign adenoma. Microscopic calcium deposits in both kidneys are noted. No free fluid or loculated collections are present within the abdominal cavity. Additionally, no significant lymph nodes or lytic lesions are detected in the examined bone structures.
