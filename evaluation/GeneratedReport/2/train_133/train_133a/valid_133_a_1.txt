The evaluation was limited due to the presence of mediastinal vascular structures, and the cardiac assessment was performed without the use of intravenous contrast. The mediastinal major vascular structures, as well as the heart's contour and size, appear to be within normal limits. However, there is evidence of pericardial effusion-thickening present. The trachea and both main bronchi are patent, and no obstructive pathology is identified in the lumen. The thoracic esophagus has a normal caliber with no significant pathological wall thickening. No enlarged lymph nodes of pathological size were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Upon examining the lung parenchyma window, the aeration in both lung parenchymas appears abnormal, with nodular and infiltrative lesions detected. No pleural effusion-thickening was observed. The assessed upper abdominal organs are unremarkable. Notably, a space-occupying lesion is present in the liver within the cross-sectional area surveyed. Both adrenal glands appear abnormal, with a space-occupying lesion confirmed. The bone structures observed in the study area are abnormal. However, vertebral corpus heights are significantly reduced compared to healthy levels. Therefore, while multiple organ systems appear to be functioning normally, particular concerns arise within the lungs and the abdominal region.
