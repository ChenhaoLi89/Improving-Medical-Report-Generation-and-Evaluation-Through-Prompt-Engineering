The examination revealed the absence of occlusive pathology in the trachea and both main bronchi. Notably, wall calcifications indicative of tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica were identified in the trachea and main bronchi. Due to limitations during the non-contrast examination, a thorough evaluation of the mediastinum was compromised. The anterior-posterior diameter of the ascending aorta measures 42 mm, while the descending aorta measures 31 mm. The calibration of the pulmonary arteries appears normal; however, the size of the heart is decreased. No pericardial effusion or thickening detected. Atherosclerotic wall calcifications were visible in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries, with significant calcification of the aortic valve noted. The thoracic esophagus shows normal calibration, and there are no significant pathological wall thickening. There were no enlarged lymph nodes found in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Secondary to documented motion artifacts; passive atelectatic changes were related to the upper lobe segments of both lungs. Furthermore, an increase in subpleural adipose tissue was noted in the posterolateral area of the right upper lobe, considered as sequelae. No mass lesions or active infiltrations with distinguishable borders were observed in either lung. The upper abdominal organs, including the liver, appear normal, without any detected space-occupying lesions. The bilateral adrenal glands were also normal. Moderate spur formations bridging each other were noted in the anterior aspect of the vertebrae in the mid-thoracic region. Only minor schmorl nodules were recorded in the end plateaus of thoracic vertebrae.
