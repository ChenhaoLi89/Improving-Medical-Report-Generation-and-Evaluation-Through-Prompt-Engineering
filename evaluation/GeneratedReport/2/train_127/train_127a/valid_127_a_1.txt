The evaluation of the trachea and both main bronchi showed no obstructive pathology. The mediastinum could not be optimally assessed during the non-contrast examination; however, the main vascular structures and heart contour appeared normal. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion or thickening noted. A small amount of atherosclerotic wall calcification was observed in the aortic arch and the coronary arteries, and the aortic valve showed signs of mild calcification. Notably, in the distal esophagus, there was a concentric increase in wall thickness with a smooth surface, measuring 6.7 mm at its thickest point over a 5.9 cm segment, leading up to the junction where paraesophageal lymph nodes were detected, the largest measuring 10x6 mm. Consultation with endoluminal examination is advisable. No enlarged lymph nodes were present in the prevascular or pre-paratracheal areas. Lung parenchyma showed emphysematous changes predominantly in the upper lobes, with mosaic attenuation in lower lobes, indicating potential issues related to airway stenosis. Several parenchymal nodules were identified, some being calcified, particularly in the anterobasal segment of the lower right lung lobe; additional follow-up with past examinations is suggested. Despite dense findings, mass lesions with distinguishing margins were absent in the lung parenchyma. Upper abdominal organs appeared typically normal, advancing evidence of a tiny hepatic lesion, while the gallbladder contained a stone measuring 1.5 cm. Bone structures in the examination area were unremarkable.
