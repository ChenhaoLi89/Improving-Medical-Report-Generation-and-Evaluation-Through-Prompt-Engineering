The trachea and both main bronchi are patent. The mediastinal main vascular structures and the contour and size of the heart are within normal limits. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is reported as abnormal. No signs of pericardial effusion or thickening were observed. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is normal, with no substantial wall thickening indicative of tumors detected. There are no enlarged lymph nodes noted in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions with pathological dimensions. Upon evaluation of the lung parenchyma, the aeration of both lung fields is normal, and no nodular or infiltrative lesions are present. Furthermore, no pleural effusions or thickening have been detected. The upper abdominal organs included in the assessment appear normal. The liver shows no space-occupying lesions within the examined area. However, there is pronounced steatosis in the liver parenchyma. The bilateral adrenal glands are intact, and no space-occupying tumors are apparent. The bone structures within the examined area are unremarkable, and the heights of the vertebral bodies are preserved. There is evidence of vertebral compression, contradicting the initial assessment. Overall, the findings are largely unremarkable, with the aforementioned exceptions concerning the thoracic aorta and vertebral bodies.
