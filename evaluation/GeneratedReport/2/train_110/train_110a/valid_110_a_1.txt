The trachea and main bronchi are widely open, and there is no significant pathological increase in wall thickness observed in the esophagus. Contrarily, unilateral lymphadenopathy was noted in the mediastinum. The heart and mediastinal vascular structures could not be evaluated optimally due to a lack of contrast, yet they appear relatively normal. Thickening or effusion in the pleura was not present in either hemithorax. Upon evaluating both lung parenchyma, no active infiltration or dominant mass lesion is evident; however, some significant masses are reported along with a few millimetric nodules that are non-specific. In the upper abdominal sections evaluated, no pathology was noted, and there were no lytic or destructive lesions identified in the bone structures, maintaining their integrity. The findings collectively indicate a stable mediastinal environment, although the unidentified masses warrant further investigation to ascertain their nature. It is important to continue monitoring these observations over time to ensure that no significant changes arise. Moreover, the radicular structures were ill-defined, leaving room for misinterpretation; hence, further imaging might be recommended. Overall, the examination demonstrated reassuring findings with a few minor abnormalities that are considered clinically insignificant for now.
