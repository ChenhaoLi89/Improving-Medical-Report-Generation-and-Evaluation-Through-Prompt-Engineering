The trachea appears to be centrally located between both main bronchi, and there are no signs of obstructive pathology within the lumen. The mediastinum could not be optimally assessed during the non-contrast examination; however, the main vascular structures within the mediastinum appear normal, and the contour and size of the heart are also unremarkable. Importantly, pericardial effusion or thickening was not encountered. The thoracic esophagus displays normal calibration with no significant pathological wall thickening present. A small sliding type hiatal hernia is noted at the lower end of the esophagus. No enlarged lymph nodes were observed in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions. In the lung parenchyma window, only a few nodules less than 5 mm in diameter were noted in the left lung, and no mass lesions or active infiltrates with indistinct borders were found in either lung. The included upper abdominal organs appear abnormal, with several lesions in the liver identified within the cross-sectional area. Both adrenal glands show space-occupying lesions atypical for normal tissue. Mild scoliosis with right opening was noted at the thoracic level, and the height of the vertebral corpus is preserved. A left-to-right curvature in thoracic scoliosis was identified during evaluation.
