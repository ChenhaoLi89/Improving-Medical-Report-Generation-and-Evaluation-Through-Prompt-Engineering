The mediastinum could not be adequately assessed during the non-contrast examination. The trachea appears midline concerning both main bronchi, without any obstructive pathology noted in the lumen. The right lower-middle lobe bronchus shows no signs of obliteration by a mass. However, the left upper lobe bronchus demonstrates significant narrowing. The mediastinal vascular structures and the heart's contour and size are normal. Notably, coronary arteries reveal signs of atherosclerotic wall calcifications. No effusion is identified in the pericardial space, and pericardial thickening is absent. Esophageal luminal calibration is within normal limits, with no evident pathological thickening detected. Numerous lymph nodes are observed in the right upper and left lower paratracheal regions, aortopulmonary space, subcranial and paraaortic areas, including a notable node anterior to the right main bronchus, the largest measuring 17 mm in diameter (no prior measurements available). A substantial pleural effusion is noted in the left pleural space but not on the right. In the lung parenchyma assessment, extensive areas of consolidation, irregular interlobular septal thickenings, and multiple nodules are present in both lungs, significantly obstructing the right lung's upper and lower lobe bronchi. The evaluation of upper abdominal organs highlights multiple hypodense lesions in the liver, specifically in segment 4B, suggesting metastasis, with no thickening observed in the adrenal glands. Lastly, no current abnormalities are found in the kidneys, although extensive sclerotic changes are evident in the bone structures.
