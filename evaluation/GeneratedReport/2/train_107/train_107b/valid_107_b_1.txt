The current examination indicates a notable increase in density and heterogeneity in the mediastinal fatty planes likely due to post-treatment effects. Both the trachea and bronchial lumens are clear, with no occlusive pathology found in these areas. Thoracic main vascular structures show normal calibration, and no aortic dilation is present. The heart contour appears within normal limits, and there is no evidence of pericardial thickening or effusion. The thoracic esophagus shows normal caliber with no significant wall thickening detected. In the analysis of the lung parenchyma, regression of the previously noted soft tissue density in the left upper lobe's paramediastinal area is evident. Conversely, evaluation of both lung parenchyma windows reveals diffuse emphysematous changes along with an increase in interstitial pattern density. Notably, there are signs of atelectasis in the lower lobe of the left lung. However, there are new extensive areas of consolidation identified across all lobes of the left lung, initially suggestive of a nonspecific inflammatory process. Clinical correlation is advisable. Additionally, in the upper abdominal regions examined, hypodense mass lesions compatible with fibrosis were observed in the liver; these lesions remain uncharacterized due to the lack of contrast. The largest mass was identified in segment 4b, measuring approximately 30 mm. Importantly, new hygromas have arisen, contributing to substantial distortion in the overall abdominal framework. Extensive sclerotic bone lesions are visible across the assessed bony structures.
