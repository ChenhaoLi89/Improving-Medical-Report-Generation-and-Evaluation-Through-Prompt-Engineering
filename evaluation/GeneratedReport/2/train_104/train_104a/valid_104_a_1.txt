The trachea and both main bronchi are open, and the contours of the mediastinal main vascular structures and heart appear normal with no changes in size. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is within normal limits. No pericardial effusion or thickening was noted. However, we observed extensive calcific plaques in the coronary arteries. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus remains normal, and significant tumoral wall thickening was ruled out. Notably, there are enlarged lymph nodes present in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary areas, exceeding pathological dimensions. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma window, minimal bronchiectasis in both lungs was found. Furthermore, no evidence of infiltration was detected in the lung parenchyma and significant pleural effusion or thickening was absent. Evaluation of the upper abdominal organs revealed diffuse density loss in the liver, along with the comprehension of a large generic mass in the gallbladder. Moreover, millimetric stones are seen, with osteoporosis of the thoracic vertebrae and moderate fibrotic densities occupying adjacent lung parenchyma observable in imaging. This radiological examination suggests a consistent structure throughout the thoracic cavity, revealing areas for further monitoring in upcoming evaluations. Any abnormalities in clinical findings may require additional follow-up assessments to ensure refined and accurate diagnosis of thoracic and abdominal conditions.
