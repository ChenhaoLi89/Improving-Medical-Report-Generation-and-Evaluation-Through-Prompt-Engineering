The findings from the CT scan demonstrate that the central mediastinal structures appear within normal limits. The sizing of major mediastinal vessels is typically calibrated. Thymic tissue is present in the anterior mediastinum, demonstrating a trigonal formation; however, it does not create any mass effect, and we note hypodense areas indicative of normal fat involution. No abnormal lymph nodes are identified in the mediastinum with respect to size or shape, nor are any found in the hilar regions. Both hemithoraxes are symmetrical. The assessment of the trachea and main bronchi reveals normal dimensions with clear lumens. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is within normal limits, and no significant tumor-related wall thickening is identified. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary areas are absent, as expected. Upon examining the lung parenchyma, two nonspecific nodules are noted; one measures 2 mm in diameter and is situated within the interlobar fissure of the left lung, alongside a second, larger nodule measuring 4 mm, which appears of concern. No evidence of pneumonia is observed. Further evaluations of upper abdominal organs show calculi around 5 mm in diameter within the middle segment of the right kidney. The bilateral adrenal glands appear normal, with no evident mass lesions, while slight benign changes in the bony walls in the evaluated areas are visualized.
