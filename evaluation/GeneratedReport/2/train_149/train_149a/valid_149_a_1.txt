The trachea and both main bronchi appear patent, with no obstructive pathology identified. Optimal evaluation of mediastinal vascular structures and the cardiac examination was compromised due to inadequate contrast use. The measurement of mediastinal vascular structures and the heart's size and contour appear normal. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion or thickening. The thoracic esophagus demonstrates normal caliber, revealing no significant wall thickening. Mediastinal lymph node stations noted non-pathological lymph nodes, the largest measuring 12 mm in diameter at the precarinal level. When observing the lung parenchyma, areas of consolidation were identified in both lower lobe superior segments and in the anterior-apical segment of the right lung upper lobe, characterized by common consolidative characteristics and detected air bronchograms. These findings likely relate to an infectious pathology (TBC suspected), and a follow-up CT is recommended post-treatment. Emphysematous changes with sustaining fibrotic structures indicative of structural distortion were noted in the apical segment of the right lung upper lobe. In the abdominal sections, nodular lesions with a hypodense, fluid density and localized cortical exophytic extension in both kidneys suggest cysts. An irregularly shaped aneurysm was found in the abdominal aorta, resulting in a wavy appearance on imaging. While no destructive lytic lesions were evident in the bone structures, moderate deterioration in vertebral corpus height was recorded, consistent with degenerative conditions.
