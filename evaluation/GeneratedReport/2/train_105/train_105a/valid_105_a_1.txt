The trachea and both main bronchi are clear and patent. Discrete calcific atheroma plaques are present in the aorta and coronary arteries. The mediastinal vascular structures and heart size appear normal, with no signs of pericardial effusion or thickening. The thoracic esophagus exhibits normal calibration, and there is no significant tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions are no evident. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma, sequelae of pulmonary fibrotic changes are noted in the upper lobes of both lungs. A left lung upper lobe apical segment shows an irregular localized nodular ground-glass density, raising the possibility of a previous infection other than Covid-19. Furthermore, two nonspecific well-defined pulvini are identified in the posterior segment of the left lung upper lobe. Both lungs exhibit regions of diffuse emphysematous changes. The upper abdominal organs visible in the scans are unremarkable. No space-occupying lesions have been identified in the liver or bilateral adrenal glands. The thoracic vertebrae show normal morphologies with no sclerotic changes observed. The patient is advised to have all previous examinations reviewed in conjunction with this assessment. If clinically warranted, further cervical imaging can be conducted in relation to potential spinal metastases.
