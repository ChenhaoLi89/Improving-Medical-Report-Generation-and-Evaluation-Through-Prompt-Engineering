CTO is decreased in favor of the heart. The main vascular structures in the mediastinum are abnormal. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is enlarged. There is evidence of pericardial effusion-thickening observed. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is irregular, and significant tumoral wall thickening is apparent. Furthermore, there is no hiatal hernia noted. No lymph nodes exhibiting pathological size or configuration were observed at the mediastinal and hilar levels. When assessed in the lung parenchyma window, both hemithorax are asymmetrical. The trachea and main bronchi show an abnormal calibration. The lumens contain obstructions. Common areas of consolidative parenchyma and ground-glass densities could be seen primarily in the left lung. Moreover, bilateral pleural effusion and pneumothorax were detected. The surrounding soft tissue planes show irregularities. Degenerative changes are absent in the bone structure. Overall, the examination reveals several noteworthy findings that suggest ongoing issues requiring further monitoring and potential intervention. Ultimately, focusing on correcting the more pressing conditions could enhance patient health and prevent additional complications. This comprehensive assessment aims to provide significant insight into the current state of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems of the patient, guiding future clinical decisions and treatment approaches to improve overall patient outcomes.
