The CTO presents as normal, with the trachea and both main bronchi showing no obstruction. The mediastinal vascular structures and the heart exhibit a normal contour and size, and the diameter of the thoracic aorta is within normal limits. A concerning pericardial effusion or thickening was not evident. Assessment of the thoracic esophagus indicated normal calibration with no significant tumoral wall thickening observed. No enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions reveal any pathological dimensions. Evaluation of the lung parenchyma corroborates normal aeration, revealing no nodular or infiltrative lesions. Notably, there is an observable pleural effusion-thickening that was identified. Additionally, within the upper abdominal organs, there is a noted nodular formation consistent with an accessory spleen adjacent to the spleen. A hypodense lesion observed in the left kidney is incompatible with a cortical cyst and is actually indicative of renal stone formation. Furthermore, severe degenerative changes in the observed bone structures are prevalent across the examination area. Overall, the findings suggest a predominantly normal thoracic and abdominal assessment but highlight a need for further evaluation regarding the lesions noted.
