The trachea and both main bronchi were located in the midline, with no restrictive pathology observed within the lumen. The assessment of the mediastinum was suboptimal due to the non-contrast nature of the examination. The configuration of the mediastinal major vascular structures, as seen, appeared abnormal. Atherosclerotic calcifications were noted within the thoracic-abdominal aorta and coronary arteries. The heart size was reduced, with neither the mitral valve nor the aortic valve exhibiting calcification. No pericardial effusion or thickening was present. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated normal calibration, and no significant tumor-like wall thickening was identified. There were no enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions meeting pathological criteria. Analysis of the lung parenchyma revealed mild peribronchial thickening centralized in both lungs. Emphysematous changes were noted, alongside bullae formation in both apices. The left hemidiaphragm appeared normal. However, dense pleuroparenchymal sequelae densities were observed predominantly in the right lung's middle lobe, left upper lobe's inferior lingula, and the basal segment of the left lower lobe. No mass lesions or active infiltrations were detected in either lung, leading to evaluation in favor of a cyst. A small, simple cortical cyst was identified in the upper pole of the left kidney. The bilateral adrenal glands had an increased caliber, and there was no tumor formation detected. Bone structures showed signs of osteopenia, though vertebral corpus heights remain unchanged.
