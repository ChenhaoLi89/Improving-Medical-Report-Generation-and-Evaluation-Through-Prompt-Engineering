The examination was performed without contrast, and evaluation of the mediastinal structures was deemed adequate. The trachea and the lumens of both main bronchi appeared closed with no obstructive pathology detected in these structures. The major vascular structures in the mediastinum were reported to be normal. No calcific atherosclerotic changes were noted in the walls of the thoracic aorta or coronary arteries. Heart size was observed to be normal, without evidence of cardiomegaly. No pleural thickening or effusion was present. Esophageal calibration was evaluated as abnormal, with significant pathological wall thickening noted. No lymph nodes of concerning size or appearance were identified in the mediastinal region or bilateral hila. Upon examination of lung parenchyma, some mild peribronchial thickening was observed primarily around the right lung's apex. Emphysematous changes were noted bilaterally. Compared to the previous examination, the size and number of nonspecific parenchymal nodules remained unchanged, with the largest nodule measuring 6 mm in diameter in the right upper lobe. There was evidence of a mass-infiltration in both lung parenchyma. Additionally, denser pleuroparenchymal sequelae were identified in both lower lobes. It was evaluated in favor of biopsy for confirmation. Notably, a millimetric simple cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney was found, while both adrenal glands appeared dysplastic. Lastly, several lytic-destructive lesions were observed in the patientâ€™s bone structures.
