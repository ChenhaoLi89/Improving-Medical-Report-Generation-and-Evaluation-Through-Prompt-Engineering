The examination revealed that the trachea and both main bronchi were positioned adequately in the midline without any evidence of obstructive pathology in the lumen. However, the non-contrast evaluation provided only limited assessment of the mediastinum. The available imaging suggested that the mediastinal main vascular structures and the heart contour appeared abnormal, while the size was also suboptimal. Notably, there was no pericardial effusion or thickening detected during the study. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus was observed to be normal, and significant tumoral wall thickening was unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary areas, indicating normative dimensions. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma, reticulonodular sequelae and fibrotic density increases were evidenced in both lung bases. There was a notable mass lesion with active infiltration present in the right lung. The upper abdominal organs accounted for in the imaging were deemed normal, and no space-occupying lesion was noted in the liver. Bilateral adrenal glads displayed anomalies with multiple lesions observed. The bone structures within the study area were noted to have signs of degeneration, with vertebral corpus heights partially preserved. Further evaluation complements the findings regarding lung pathologies, governing clinical decisions informed by the detailed observations made in this report.
