The trachea and both main bronchi are open with no evidence of occlusive pathology detected. There is a pathological increase in wall thickness observed in the thoracic esophagus. Mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac evaluation were not optimally assessed due to the absence of contrast enhancement. The calibration of the mediastinal vascular structures, heart contour, and size appears to be consistent with normal findings. Additionally, pericardial and pleural effusion are observed. Mildly calcified atheromatous plaques are present on the aorta and coronary vessels. No lymphadenopathy of pathological size or appearance is noted in both axillary regions, the supraclavicular area, or the mediastinum. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma, no active infiltration or mass lesions are evident in both lungs; however, two small bronchiectasis formations are noted, primarily in the central areas. Emphysematous changes are present in both lungs, most notably in the upper lobes. An increase in density causing structural distortion and volume loss is particularly noticeable in the apex regions of both lungs, especially on the anterior sections. Moreover, moderate height loss is observed in the upper end plateau of the T3 vertebra among other spinal structures depicted in the imaging. Overall, the vertebra corpus shows a reduced anteroposterior diameter, leading to a conclusion favoring malignant compression.
