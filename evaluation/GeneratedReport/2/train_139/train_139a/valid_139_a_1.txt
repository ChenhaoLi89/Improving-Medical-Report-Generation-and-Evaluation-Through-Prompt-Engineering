The trachea and both main bronchi are unobstructed. The mediastinal major vascular structures, as well as the contour and size of the heart, appear normal. A significant effusion with an anterior-posterior diameter of 29 mm is noted in the widest part of the pericardial region, which is directed upward. The thoracic esophagus displays normal calibration with no considerable pathological wall thickening identified. There are prominent enlarged lymph nodes present in the prevascular, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions that reflect pathological dimensions. When assessed in the lung parenchyma window, aeration of both lung parenchyma is normal, and no nodular or infiltrative lesions are identified. However, there is evidence of pleural effusion-thickening. The upper abdominal organs scanned are consistent with normal findings. Notably, a small space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver; however, both adrenal glands are normal and show no abnormalities. Bone structures within the examined area appear defect-free, with vertebral corpus heights markedly decreased. Overall, the findings reflect a comprehensive analysis of the thoracic and upper abdominal regions, with concentration needed in the management of detected anomalies.
