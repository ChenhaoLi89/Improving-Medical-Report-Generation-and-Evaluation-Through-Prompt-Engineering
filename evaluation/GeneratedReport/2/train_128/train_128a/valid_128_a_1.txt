The CTO is unremarkable. The calibration of the ascending aorta measures 41 mm, appearing narrower than usual. The descending aorta appears mildly retracted. The aortic arch measures 32 mm and is within normal limits. Calibration of the other major vascular structures in the mediastinum is considered healthy. A catheter is evident within the inferior vena cava. Concerning findings include calcific atheroma plaques present in the coronary arteries, descending aorta, and aortic arch without any significant lymphadenopathy noted in the mediastinum, with lymph nodes at both hilar regions remaining unremarkable. The thoracic esophagus remains of normal caliber, and no substantial tumor-related wall thickening is present. In assessing the lung’s parenchyma, the trachea and major bronchi appear normal, although some thickening of the peribronchovascular sheath is noticed, particularly in the right lower lobe and left upper segment. Sequelae from previous injuries as well as areas showing emphysematous densities are found universally. Notably, there’s a linear density representing pleuroparenchymal changes in both lower lobes. A 4 mm nodule in the apical segment remains stable along with a previously observed 5.5 mm nodule that persists at similar dimensions and locational integrity. Ultrasonography rather than proceeding with surgical evaluation is suggested after examining a distended gallbladder inadvertently noted during upper abdominal imaging. Evidence suggests neutral boundary interruptions of involvement in the parinephric region related to renal shadows may indicate negative development, as new cancellous lesions undergo an invasive evolution potentially requiring follow-up.
