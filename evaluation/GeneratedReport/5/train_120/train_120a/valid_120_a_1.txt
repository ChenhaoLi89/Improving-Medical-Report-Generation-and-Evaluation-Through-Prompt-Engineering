Bilateral gynecomastia was noted. The trachea and both main bronchi appeared shifted towards the left, displaying obstructive pathology within the lumen. In the non-contrast examination, mediastinal evaluation was suboptimal. However, the mediastinal main vascular structures and heart size appeared abnormal. Notably, pericardial effusion-thickening was observed. There is no stent material identified in the coronary arteries. Evaluation of the thoracic esophagus revealed significant pathological wall thickening. Additionally, enlarged lymph nodes consistent with pathological dimensions were present in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. When assessed in the lung parenchyma window, segmentary tubular bronchiectasis and moderate peribronchial thickening were identified in both lungs. Prominent interlobular septal thickening, subpleural lines, and accompanying ground glass densities and honeycomb appearance were observed in the subpleural areas and basal segments of both lungs. The findings indicated evidence of fibrotic changes due to historical Covid-19 pneumonia. Pleuroparenchymal fibrosis was noted in the left lung's upper lobe lingular segment. Parenchymal nodules were absent in both lungs. Within the upper abdominal organs examined, abnormalities were detected, specifically showing signs of significant space-occupying lesions in the liver. Mild thickening was noted in both adrenal glands, categorically normal on the right. Enhanced osteodegenerative changes were evaluated in numerous bone structures in the examination area.
