The examination revealed no obstructive pathology in the lumen of the trachea or both main bronchi. Although the mediastinum could not be optimally evaluated during the non-contrast examination, the visible mediastinal vascular structures and the heart's contour and size appear to be normal. However, pericardial effusion thickening was identified. Atherosclerotic wall calcifications were noted in the aortic arch and coronary arteries, and it was found that the aortic valve is uncalcified. In the distal esophagus, there was a marked concentric wall thickening observed over a 5.9 cm segment, with the thickest measured point at 6.7 mm. Notably, paraesophageal lymph nodes were identified, with the largest measuring 9x5.5 mm, and endoluminal examination is warranted. Importantly, no enlarged lymph nodes were detected in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions with pathological sizes. Examination of the lung parenchyma indicated central emphysema in the upper lobes of both lungs, along with signs of mosaic attenuation patterns apparent in various lung segments. Additionally, bronchial wall thickening and luminal narrowing were present. Numerous calcified parenchymal nodules were identified, with the largest adjacent to each other in the right lung's lower lobe. Pleuroparenchymal changes consistent with fibroatelectasis were documented in the right middle lobe and left upper lobe's inferior lingular segment. No mass lesions or active infiltrations with distinct borders were observed in the lung parenchyma. The upper abdominal organs assessed were normal with no lesions in the liver or kidneys noted, and a stone measuring 1 cm was found in the gallbladder. The bone structures have sites indicating pathways of compression and diminished vertebral height in the studied area.
