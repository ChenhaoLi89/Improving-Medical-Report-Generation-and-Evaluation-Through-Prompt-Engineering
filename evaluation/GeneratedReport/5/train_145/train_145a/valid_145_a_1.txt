The trachea and both main bronchi are unobstructed. The mediastinum could not be satisfactorily assessed in the non-contrast examination. The available observations indicate that the main vascular structures in the mediastinum, as well as the heart contours and size, are abnormal. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is dilated. Notably, a significant pericardial effusion-thickening was observed. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated a suspicious description, with evidence of extensive tumoral wall thickening noted. There were enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular area, pre-paratracheal region, subcarinal spaces, and bilateral hilar-axillary zones of pathological significance. Upon analysis of the lung parenchyma, aeration of the lung tissue was deemed abnormal, revealing the presence of multiple nodular and infiltrative lesions. Pleural thickening and effusions were corroborated. The evaluation of upper abdominal organs within the scanned sections exhibited abnormalities. A space-occupying lesion was identified in the liverâ€™s cross-sectional area. Both adrenal glands presented abnormalities with the finding of space-occupying lesions. In the left kidney, there is a notable hyperdense finding in the upper pole pelvicalyceal structure concerning for a large calculus. Bone structures within the investigation's field exhibit significant abnormalities. The heights of the vertebral bodies were poorly preserved.
