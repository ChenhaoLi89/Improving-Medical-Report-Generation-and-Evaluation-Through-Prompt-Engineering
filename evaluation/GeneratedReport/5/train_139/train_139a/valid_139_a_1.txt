The trachea and both main bronchi are patent. The mediastinal vascular structures, as well as the contour and size of the heart, appear normal. However, a notable effusion with an anterior-posterior diameter of 29 mm is observed in the pericardial area, extending superiorly. The thoracic esophagus shows normal calibration with no significant pathological wall thickening identified. Additionally, enlarged lymph nodes are observed in the prevascular space, pre-paratracheal area, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, all exceeding normal dimensions. Assessing the lung parenchyma, both lung sections are well-aerated, revealing no nodular or infiltrative lesions within the parenchyma. Nonetheless, isolated pleural effusion-thickening is present. The evaluated upper abdominal organs return normal findings. No space-occupying lesions are detected within the liver included in the cross-sectional views, while both adrenal glands remain normal without any masses. Bone structures shown in the study area are irregular. The heights of vertebral bodies are preserved in the examined areas, though evidence of compression fractures is depicted in select vertebrae. Overall, the report indicates multiple areas of interest that require further assessment and monitoring moving forward since there is noted disease progression. Further imaging and clinical correlation are recommended to clarify the findings noted.
