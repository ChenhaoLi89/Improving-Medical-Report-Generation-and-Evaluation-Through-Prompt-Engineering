The trachea and both main bronchi are clear without obstruction. Mediastinal vascular structures appear normal, while the size of the heart is notably reduced. The diameter of the thoracic aorta falls within normal limits. There is no pericardial effusion, and there is thickening in the pericardial region observed. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is within normal ranges, with no significant tumoral wall thickening evident. In the mediastinum, several lymph nodes are noted, with abbreviated short axes measuring up to 5 mm and exhibiting differences. Upon review of the lung parenchyma window, implants are identified in the lower lobe of the right lung, with lesions measuring up to 15x10 mm, including the one with smooth margins. Multiple lesions show cavitary formations, evidenced notably in the right lung only. An increase in the size of the liver and spleen is noted, along with findings suggestive of splenomegaly. Bone structures in the surrounding area display abnormal characteristics, indicating potential pathology within the visual field. Vertebral body heights are reduced, indicating possible degenerative changes. Overall, the imaging reveals significant abnormalities concerning lung lesions which require further evaluation correlating with clinical findings.
