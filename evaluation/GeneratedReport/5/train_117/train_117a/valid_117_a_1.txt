The trachea and both main bronchi appear within normal limits, with no signs of obstructive pathology noted. There is evidence of minimal bronchiectasis in the peripheral regions of both lungs, along with mild emphysematous changes present bilaterally. Linear atelectasis is occasionally detected in the lung fields. Bilateral nodules were also identified, and given the primary disease context, these are suggested to be benign rather than metastatic. The largest nodule, located in the apicoposterior segment of the left lung upper lobe, measures roughly 8x11 mm at its widest point. Both lungs do not display any mass lesions or areas of infiltrative disease. Evaluation of mediastinal structures is limited due to prior contrast administration. The cardiac silhouette and size appear normal, with no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion seen. There are no notable atheroma plaques observed in the aorta and coronary arteries. The dimensions of the main vascular structures in the mediastinum are within normal limits. A port chamber is seen in the left hemithorax, with the catheter terminating within the inferior vena cava. No enlarged lymph nodes are present in the mediastinal or hilar regions. The esophagus shows no abnormal wall thickening, and no collections of free fluid or identifiable masses are noted in the upper abdomen. Finally, the bones demonstrate no significant fractures or lesions that raise concern.
