The port chamber is visible on the anterior chest wall, along with an image of the catheter reaching the right atrium. The trachea and both main bronchi are positioned in the midline, and obstructive pathology within the lumen is noted. Due to the non-contrast imaging, the mediastinum could not be fully assessed. Observations indicate that the primary vascular structures and cardiac silhouette appear abnormal, with signs of fluid accumulation around the pericardium. The thoracic esophagus shows significant wall thickening; however, overall calibration remains within normal limits. Enlarged lymph nodes in several anatomical locations, including prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, did not meet pathological criteria. When reviewing lung parenchyma, numerous millimetric nodules are identified in the lower lobes, alongside a mass lesion having indistinct borders within the parenchyma. Findings within the upper abdominal organs unfortunately could not clearly confirm their condition. A 2 cm space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver during examination. Both adrenal glands demonstrate abnormalities, which could indicate possible masses. The bone structures in the relevant regions appear well-preserved, with vertebral corpus heights diminished. The assessment of intra-abdominal solid organs showed normal results with no significant concerns requiring MRI correlation.
