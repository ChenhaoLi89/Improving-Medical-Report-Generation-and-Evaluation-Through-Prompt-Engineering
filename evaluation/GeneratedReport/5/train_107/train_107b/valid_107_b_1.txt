During the current examination, a notable increase in density and heterogeneity, likely due to post-treatment effects, was observed in the mediastinal fatty planes. The trachea and main bronchi are patent, with no obstructions present. The calibration of the thoracic major vascular structures appears normal. Additionally, slight dilation of the thoracic aorta was detected. The heart's contour is abnormal, with evidence of pericardial effusion characterized by thickening. Evaluation of the thoracic esophagus reveals normal calibration, and no significant pathological wall thickening was observed. In the lung parenchyma, soft tissue density in the paramediastinal region of the left upper lobe exhibited extensive regression compared to previous exams. Evaluation of both lung parenchyma demonstrates emphysematous changes bilaterally, alongside a marked increase in density of the interstitial pattern. Atelectasis is observed in the lower left lobe, with abundant areas of consolidation affecting the right lung lobes. The left lung shows extensive consolidation and infiltrative changes, particularly in the lower lobe segment. This pattern suggests potential infectious processes, warranting clinical and laboratory correlation. Infiltrative, hyperdense masses consistent with metastasis were detected in the liver. The largest, located in segment 4b, measures 20 mm based on the examination findings. No significant regression from the previous measure of 39 mm can be confirmed due to lack of contrast. Free fluid was identified, suggesting new emergence. Bone structures exhibit extensive osteoporosis without sclerotic lesions in the examined areas.
