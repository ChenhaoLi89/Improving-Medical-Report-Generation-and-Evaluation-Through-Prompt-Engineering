The mediastinum could not be extensively evaluated during the non-contrast examination. The trachea appears reasonably positioned in the midline in relation to both main bronchi, with no significant obstructive pathology detected in the lumen. A sizable mass was observed in the right lower-middle lobe bronchus, and the left upper lobe bronchus shows mild narrowing. The contours and size of mediastinal vascular structures as well as the heart are within normal limits. There was an absence of atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries. A notable effusion was present in the pericardial space, accompanied by pericardial thickening. Evaluation of thoracic esophageal dimensions appeared abnormal with evidence of significant pathological wall thickening. Various lymph nodes were identified in areas including the right upper paratracheal, left lower paratracheal, aortopulmonary, subcranial, and paraaortic regions near the right main bronchus, with the largest node being 24 mm in diameter, which increased compared to the previous examination. An acute effusion was noted in the left pleural space, measuring 12 mm in thickness. Through examining the lung parenchyma window, substantial areas of consolidation and irregularities in interlobular septal thickness were found impacting both lungs and consistently narrowing key bronchi. Evaluation of upper abdominal organs revealed liver changes in segment 4B consistent with cysts, numerous lesions timed for follow-up. Both adrenal glands appeared unaffected, and sclerotic areas in the bone structures were minimized compared to previous assessments.
