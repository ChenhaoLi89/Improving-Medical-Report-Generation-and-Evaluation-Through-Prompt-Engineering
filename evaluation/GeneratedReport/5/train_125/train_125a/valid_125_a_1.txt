No significant occlusive pathology was found in the trachea or the lumen of both main bronchi. Wall calcifications indicative of tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica were noted in the tracheal and bronchial walls. Due to limitations in the non-contrast evaluation, the mediastinum was not fully assessed. The anterior-posterior measurement of the ascending aorta was reported as 52 mm, while that of the descending aorta was measured at 26 mm. The size of the pulmonary arteries was normal. The heart appeared to be enlarged. No evidence of pericardial effusion or thickening was found. Signs of atherosclerotic calcifications were present in both the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries. The aortic valve exhibited no signs of calcification. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus remained normal with no significant wall thickening noted. No enlarged lymph nodes in the included areas presented pathological size. Notably, due to motion artifacts, passive atelectatic changes were noted in the right lungâ€™s upper lobe and the inferior segments of the left lung. There was a noted decrease in subpleural adipose tissue in the posterolateral area of the right lung's upper lobe, interpreted as unchanged. No identifiable mass lesions were present in either lung. Within the sections inspected, the upper abdominal organs appeared abnormal, and no lesions were detected in the liver. Normal findings were reported for both adrenal glands. Interestingly, spur formations connecting in the left anterior corner of the vertebral body were seen at the mid-thoracic level with minimal schmorl nodules in the thoracic vertebral end plates.
