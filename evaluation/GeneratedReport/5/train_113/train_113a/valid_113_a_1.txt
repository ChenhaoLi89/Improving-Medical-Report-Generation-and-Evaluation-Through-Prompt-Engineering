The analysis indicates that the calibration of the tracheobronchial tree is within normal limits. Calibration of the primary mediastinal blood vessels appears slightly irregular. Thymic tissue is identified in the anterior mediastinum with a triangular configuration, which slightly causes mass effect; areas with reduced density suggesting fat involution have been noted. There were lymph nodes detected in the mediastinum with pathological size and configuration. Notably, pathological size lymph nodes were also observed at the hilar regions. Both hemithorax show asymmetry. The trachea and main bronchial lumens exhibit signs of obstruction. The thoracic esophagus illustrates irregular calibration, with notable wall thickening suggestive of potential malignancy. Enlarged lymph nodes in various mediastinal locations, including prevascular and subcarinal, were documented at enlarged dimensions. Upon review of the lung parenchyma, a 3 mm diameter nonspecific nodule is noted on the interlobar fissure of the right lung. Multiple significant findings consistent with pneumonia were present. In the assessment of upper abdominal organs, density consistent with 3 mm diameter stones is visible in the upper lobe of the left kidney. Bilateral adrenal glands show abnormalities, and a significant space-occupying lesion appears apparent. Extensive degenerative changes in the bony structures across the examination site are pronounced.
