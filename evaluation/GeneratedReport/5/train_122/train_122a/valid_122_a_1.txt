The trachea and both main bronchi are consistently open. The mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, and size appear normal. Notably, pericardial effusion and thickening were observed. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus was normal, and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions were present, exhibiting pathological dimensions. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma, both lungs demonstrate normal aeration, with nodular or infiltrative lesions detected in the lung parenchyma. Pleural effusion and thickening were not noted. The upper abdominal organs included in the images appear consequentially normal. A space-occupying lesion was identified in the liver that compromised the cross-sectional area. Both bilateral adrenal glands were abnormal, and a space-occupying lesion was detected. The bone structures within the study area reveal significant abnormalities. Vertebral corpus heights are not preserved, indicating potential concerns. Overall, the findings revealed several anomalies requiring further investigation and follow-up to rule out any significant pathology within the thoracic cavity and associated structures. Regular monitoring of identified abnormalities or lesions will be necessary to ensure timely intervention.
