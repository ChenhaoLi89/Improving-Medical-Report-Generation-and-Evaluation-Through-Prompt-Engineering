The trachea and the lumens of both main bronchi are patent, with no disruptive lesions identified in these regions. The ascending aorta measures 46 mm in diameter, presenting no signs of abnormality. The pulmonary artery demonstrates a diameter of 35 mm and reveals no dilation. The heart appears to be of normal size. Notably, calcifying atherosclerotic changes were found in the thoracic aorta, while increases in the densities of coronary artery stent material were absent. A significant mass identified in the lower lobe of the left lung starts centrally and extends to the pulmonary interstitium, involving the right main bronchus and partially obstructing the left bronchus. The exact dimensions of this mass reach about 14 cm internally. There are signs of consolidated lung tissue distal to the detected mass; however, this evaluation cannot separate these effects from potential malignancies. Additionally, lymph node enlargement measuring 25x22 mm was identified in the anterior mediastinum near the lungs. In the areas surveyed in the lung parenchyma, interlobular thickening is present, particularly in the right lungs, along with nodular densities observed in the lower lobe. Ground-glass opacities consistent with inflammation were noted in the destructive areas of the upper lobe. On the right side, pleural effusion was quantified at 29 mm, whereas the left side shows no effusion. Despite observing some emphysema changes, both lungs demonstrate minimal abnormalities. In the upper abdominal scan, indistinctively hypodense areas measuring 25 mm and crescent-shaped areas in the right kidney are noted. Degenerative changes in extremities are undetected.
