The trachea and both main bronchi were observed to be slightly displaced laterally, and mild obstructive pathology in the lumen was identified. During the non-contrast examination, the mediastinum was not optimally evaluated, revealing unclear findings. Mediastinal major vascular structures and heart contour appeared abnormal, with variations in size noted. There was a significant pericardial effusion and thickening observed that raised concern. The thoracic esophagus showed evidence of some calibration abnormalities with significant tumoral wall thickening detected. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal areas, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions were found to have pathological dimensions. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window, extensive reticulonodular opacities consistent with active infectious processes were noted in both lung apexes. Several mass lesions with indistinguishable borders were detected in both lungs as well. The upper abdominal organs included in the examination showed abnormalities, with a large space-occupying lesion detected in the liver within the cross-sectional area. Notably, the bilateral adrenal glands displayed signs of distress, and a space-occupying lesion was present. Bone structures in the study area showed signs of degeneration, with diminished vertebral corpus heights observed.
