A mass measuring 3 cm is seen in the thinnest part of the left lung, which does not involve the pleura. There are areas of effusion located between the pleural layers on the left, measuring 53 mm at its thickest and displaying some loculated regions. In the lower lobe of the left lung, reticular density decreases, with well-defined borders observed, which were evaluated as unlikely indicative of lymphangitic spread. Furthermore, there is a consolidation area in the upper lobe with diminished air bronchograms and improved changes. Irregular thickenings are present in the mediastinal and costal pleura. Soft tissue masses measuring 36x30 mm are found in the lateral paratracheal region, lacking a necrotic center and showing isolated lymphadenopathy. Additionally, there are substantial necrotic lymphadenopathy notices in the right hypogastric area relevant areas, with the largest measuring 1.5 cm on the long axis. Emphysematous changes are noted bilaterally. There is parenchymal fibrosis and bullae observed in the lower lobe of the right lung causing associated volume expansion. Parenchymal nodules are not present in the upper and lower lobes of the right lung. A 10 mm parenchymal nodule is noted in the lower lobe of the left lung. Significant lymphadenopathy measuring 27x17 mm is observed in the regions of arteries originating from the lower abdomen. Bone structures in the evaluated region are intact, with vertebral heights being notably decreased.
