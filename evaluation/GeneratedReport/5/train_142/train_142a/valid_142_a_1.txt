The trachea and main bronchi demonstrate clear airway patency. No abnormal increase in esophageal wall thickness was identified. Additionally, there were no pathological lymphadenopathies observed in the mediastinum. The heart and major vascular structures in the mediastinum could not be assessed in detail due to insufficient contrast, yet they appear abnormal. There were signs of pleural effusion and thickening noticed in the left hemithorax, while the right-sided pleural space appeared normal. Both lungs show no signs of active infiltration or mass lesions, although several sub-centimetric nodules were noted, which are non-specific. Emphysematous changes are primarily present in the lower lobes of both lungs, showing signs of previous lung disease in the right middle lobe posterior segment and the left lower lobe anterior basal segment. No significant pathologies were detected in the critical upper abdominal sections that were examined. Furthermore, lytic or destructive changes in bone structures were observed throughout, which potentially indicate recent trauma. Overall, the findings suggest mild emphysematous changes along with benign nodular formations, but serious underlying conditions appear to be ruled out. Regular follow-ups with imaging may be warranted for persistent findings, and further correlation with clinical data is recommended for comprehensive assessment and management.
