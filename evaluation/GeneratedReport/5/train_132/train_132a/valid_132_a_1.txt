The trachea and both primary bronchi are clear. There is significant obstructive pathology present in the trachea and both main bronchi. Mild pleuroparenchymal sequelae changes are noted in both lung apexes, along with substantial emphysematous changes in both lungs. Non-specific nodules, measuring approximately 6 mm in diameter, are seen in both lungs, with the largest located in the superior segment of the right lung’s lower lobe. A large mass or infiltrative lesion has been detected in the left lung. Evaluation of the mediastinal structures was done optimally due to adequate contrast material administration. Observation indicates that the heart’s contour and size appear abnormal. Mild pleural and pericardial effusion is present. The width of mediastinal main vascular structures is abnormal. Enlarged lymph nodes were detected in both the mediastinum and hilar regions that could be continuing to expand. A pathological increase in wall thickness in the esophagus is noted within the observed sections. Additionally, free fluid collection is detected in the upper abdomen areas. Enlarged lymph nodes in pathological dimensions were seen in the abdominal follow-ups. In the upper abdominal organs surveyed, a notable mass with indistinguishable borders was found as contributors in sections of the enhanced CT. Thoracic vertebral corpus heights, alignments and densities show abnormalities. Intervertebral disc distances are observed to be variable. Neural foramina are open, and no lytic-destructive lesions were detected in the customary bone structures within the sections examined.
