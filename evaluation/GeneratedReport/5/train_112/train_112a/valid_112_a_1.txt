The trachea and both main bronchi are clear. The evaluation of the mediastinal main vascular structures was limited due to the absence of contrast in this examination; however, the heart's contour and size were irregular. The diameter of the thoracic aorta was found to be abnormal. There was significant pericardial effusion-thickening noted. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus was abnormal, and notable tumoral wall thickening was detected. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and subcarinal regions, as well as bilaterally in the hilar-axillary areas. Upon review of the lung parenchyma window; both lung parenchyma showed abnormal aeration, and nodular lesions were present within the lung tissue. Importantly, pleural effusion-thickening was observed. The upper abdominal organs included in the sections show abnormalities. A few lytic and destructive lesions were present in the bone structures assessed in this study area. Overall, the findings reveal concerning abnormalities that warrant consideration in the patient's ongoing management plan. Further assessment and possibly intervention may be necessary based on these identified issues. Continued monitoring and additional diagnostics could be beneficial to understand or address any arising complications related to these abnormalities.
