In the evaluation, no pathological lymph nodes were found in the supraclavicular fossa or axilla, with normal size and appearance noted. The sternotomy line was traced, and previous bypass surgery findings were confirmed. Evidence suggests increased heart size, alongside moderate size pericardial effusion observed, likely of postoperative origin. There are several mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes detected in proximity to the heart. Examination of the lung parenchyma reveals pleural effusion, with measurements reaching 6.5 cm in diameter between the left pleura. Notably, adjacent to this effusion, there is compression atelectasis present; however, areas of pneumonia or consolidation have been ruled out. Furthermore, no suspicious nodular or mass-like lesions have been identified within the aerated lung parenchyma. It should also be noted that the upper abdomen display features of significant abnormalities, contrary to previous expectations. No degenerative changes were evident in the bone structures during the assessment. Overall, the examination highlights a medically stable condition, with isolated concerns regarding the pericardial effusion and pulmonary findings warranting further observation in subsequent assessments. Monitoring progress will be critical, allowing for the persisting complications to be managed effectively. Further tests may be recommended, depending on the evolution of clinical symptoms and radiographic assessments.
