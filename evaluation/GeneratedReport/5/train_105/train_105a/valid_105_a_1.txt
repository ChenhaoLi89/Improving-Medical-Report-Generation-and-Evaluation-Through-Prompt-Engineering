The trachea and both main bronchi are patent. Evidence of diffuse calcific atheroma plaques is detected within the aorta and coronary arteries. All major mediastinal vascular structures are normal, along with the contour and size of the heart. Notably, the pericardial space shows significant thickening due to effusion. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is normal, and there are no indications of significant tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar/axillary regions are within normal limits. Upon evaluation of the lung parenchyma, sequelae include fibroatelectatic changes in the upper lobes of both lungs. An unusual hypodense area is noted in the right lung upper lobe apical segmentâ€”the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia is highly suspected. Two distinct large pulmonary nodules were discerned in the posterior segment of the right lung lower lobe. Diffuse emphysematous changes are also noted in the left lung. The evaluated upper abdominal organs are unremarkable. A specific space-occupying lesion is noted in the liver surpassing the average size. Both adrenal glands show normal appearance. Thoracic vertebrae exhibit fused osteophytic tapering. Sclerotic changes noted are seen in the lower cervical vertebwral plaatues. It is advisable for the patient to be reassessed alongside any historical examinations. If deemed clinically necessary, MR imaging of the cervical spine may be appropriate for evaluating potential metastatic involvement.
