The trachea and both main bronchi are patent, with no obstructive pathology noted. Evaluation of the mediastinal structures was hindered by the lack of contrast enhancement; however, the sizes of major vascular structures appear normal. The heart's contour is consistent with normal size, and no pericardial effusion or thickening has been identified. The thoracic esophagus is normal in caliber, showing no significant pathological wall thickening. Notably, lymphadenopathies are present in the mediastinal, upper and lower paratracheal, subcarinal, and the right paratracheal/right hilar regions, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 18 mm and exhibiting a conglomerate appearance. The lung parenchyma assessment revealed bilateral peribronchial thickenings and nodular areas of consolidation, with the most significant site observed in the lower lobe mediobasal segment that is clearly distinguished from the paramediastinal area. Ground-glass opacities surround these nodules, raising the possibility of fungal infections in the differential diagnosis. Clinical correlation and follow-up studies are advised. Additionally, submillimeter gallstones were detected in the gallbladder, as well as several minuscule calculi in both kidneys. Numerous hyperdense lesions were recognized in various regions of the spleen and require further evaluation. Hypodense lesions, measuring up to 19 mm in diameter, were identified within liver segments 8 and 7; however, their characteristics could not be assessed due to the absence of contrast. A few lytic-destructive lesions were detected in the bone structures.
