The assessment of mediastinal structures was categorized as suboptimal due to the examination being unenhanced. Occlusive pathology in the trachea and the lumen of both main bronchi was not identified. An image revealed a catheter extending inferiorly to the vena cava, and the size of the thoracic main vascular structures was found to be abnormal. There was no evidence of dilatation within the thoracic aorta. The heart contour was reported as enlarged. No pericardial effusion or thickening was detected. The thoracic esophagus's calibration remained normal with no substantial pathological wall thickening noted. Comparatively to previous evaluations, stable locally conglomerated lymphadenopathies were evident in the upper and lower mediastinal paratracheal areas along with some progression in the right paratracheal-right hilar zone. The largest lymph node measured approximately 20 mm in diameter. The examination of the lung parenchyma showed bilateral peribronchial thickening, and regression in size of the nodular consolidations found in both lungs was noted. Free pleural effusions were recorded between the bilateral pleural leaves, with thicknesses of 40 mm on the right and 16 mm on the left side. In addition, a 12 mm effusion was observed in the pericardial region. When the upper abdominal region was assessed, hypodense lesions sized 21 mm in diameter were noted in the liver segments 8 and 7. This was consistent with previous findings, and there were no notable changes in other observed anomalies in this examination.
