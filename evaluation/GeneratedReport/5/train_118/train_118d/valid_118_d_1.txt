A catheter was identified extending from the right internal jugular vein to the right ventricle. There were no signs of occlusive disease in the trachea or in the lumens of both main bronchi. However, the mediastinum was not optimally evaluated in the non-contrast assessment. The main mediastinal vascular structures and heart size appeared enlarged, deviating from normal dimensions. A significant effusion was noted in the pericardial cavity. The thoracic esophagus showed abnormal calibration, with evidence of significant tumoral wall thickening. No enlarged lymph nodes were detected in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions. In the assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma, peribronchial thickening, centriacinar nodules, and ground glass opacities were seen around the bronchial areas bilaterally, particularly since the patient was monitored for areas of emphasis in lung consolidation. Moreover, a nodular consolidation-atelectasis region was identified in the right lung, although significant findings were also noted in the upper left lobe. Stable hyperdense lesions measuring 21 mm in diameter were observed in liver segments 7 and 8 upon review of the abdominal CT scans. A calculus was not detected within the gallbladder. Overall, no noteworthy variances were found compared to previous examinations except for a slight increase in liver lesion size.
