The examination indicated a slight reduction in blood flow directed towards the heart, suggesting overall decreased heart function. The major vascular structures of the mediastinum presented with abnormalities, reflecting potential vascular disease. Measurements of the thoracic aorta diameter were found to be consistent with average values for age and sex. Evidence of mild pericardial thickening was noted, though the effusion was not significant. The thoracic esophagus exhibited notable narrowing, with clear evidence of tumoral wall thickening. A hiatal hernia was confirmed. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes of significant size and irregular configuration were identified in the mediastinal and hilar regions. Upon assessment of the lung parenchyma, both hemithoraces appeared asymmetrical, and there were irregularities in trachea and main bronchi caliber. Lung segments showed significant areas of consolidative changes and ground glass opacities predominantly distributed throughout the right lung, while minor structural abnormalities were spotted bilaterally. Notably, bilateral pleural effusion and pneumothorax were present. The surrounding soft tissue planes displayed moderate fascial swelling. Furthermore, although degenerative changes were minimized in the bone structure, left-sided degenerative osteophytes were prevalent, warranting further evaluation to rule out underlying disease. Overall, the prominent findings relate mainly to identifiable moderate pulmonary processes.
