The trachea and the lumens of the main bronchi are patent with no obstructive lesions present. Mediastinal structures are assessed as suboptimal due to the non-augmented nature of the examination. The calibration of major thoracic vascular structures appears natural. The heart size is noted as reduced. No pericardial effusion or thickening is present. Absence of prosthetic material was noted in the aortic valve, and there is neither suture material nor scarring observed on the wall of the ascending aorta. The caliber of the thoracic esophagus is reported as normal with no significant pathological wall thickening. Lymphadenopathy was noted, with nodes measuring 19x11 mm in the upper and lower paratracheal, prevascular, precarinal, and subcarinal regions. The lung parenchyma findings included patchy areas of consolidation accompanied by ground glass opacities in the perihilar regions of both lungs, suggestive of an infectious process, and clinical correlation is highly recommended. In particular, no interseptal thickening was observed, contradicting any association with cardiac pathology. Free fluid is noted between the pleural layers, measuring 26 mm on the right and 5 mm on the left, with both fissures remaining thin. No significant mass lesions are detected in the lung spaces. Emphysematous changes are pronounced bilaterally. The upper abdominal structures assessed are normal, and both adrenal glands show no evidence of lesions. Notably, no metallic suture materials are observed in the sternum. There were some lytic-destructive lesions detected within the bone structures.
