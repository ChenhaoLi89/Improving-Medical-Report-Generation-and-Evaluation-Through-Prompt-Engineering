The coronary artery CTO is normal. The calibration of the ascending aorta measures 40 mm, which falls within the average range. The descending aorta is average in prominence, and the aortic arch measures 33 mm, consistent with normal findings. Calibration of other major vascular structures within the mediastinum is noted to be abnormal. A catheter is noted in the inferior vena cava. There are no calcific atheroma plaques in any vascular structures. No scintillating lymph nodes with pathological size were detected in the mediastinum, but mild lymph nodes are detected in pathological sizes at both hilar levels. Thoracic esophageal calibration shows slight enlargement, but no significant benign wall thickening is observed. In evaluating both lungs, the trachea and main bronchi appear normal; however, there is evidence of peribronchovascular sheath thickening, most pronounced in the right middle lobe and left lingular segment, along with emphysematous changes at the base. Two tiny round foci consistent with inflammatory changes were noted in the lowers lobes. A stable nodule measuring approximately 2 mm is observed in the left lung's posterior segment. There are minor sequelae changes introduced in both lungs’ middle zones, while the upper abdomen sections reveal the distended spleen—a long-standing finding. Kidneys display lobulated contours but normal density throughout. No lytic bone lesions were found. Fractures in the lower left ribs are indicative of prior injury but appear unchanged. Similar previous injuries may be detected as previously reported.
