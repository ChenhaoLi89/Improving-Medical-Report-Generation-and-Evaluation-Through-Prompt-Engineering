The trachea and both main bronchi appear clear and un obstructed, with no signs of occlusive disease noted in these airways. The ventilation of both lungs is appropriate, and both left and right lungs show no masses or infiltrative lesions. Evaluation of the mediastinal structures is compromised due to the absence of contrast material; however, visible structures suggest that the heart is of normal size and contour. There is an unusual accumulation of pleural and pericardial effusion detected. The mediastinal main vascular structures are of standard width, indicating normal vascular capacity. Notably, no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes are seen within the mediastinum or hilar regions. Imaging shows a significant pathological increase in the wall thickness of the esophagus in certain sections, further complicated by the presence of a sliding type significant hiatal hernia located at the lower segment of the esophagus. There are no upper abdominal fluid collections or aggravated lymph nodes present as identified in these areas. Additionally, the evaluation did not indicate any masses with recognizable margins in the upper abdominal organs. Fractures or lytic-destructive lesions in identified bone structures within the scanned areas are not present, suggesting intact skeletal integrity is observed throughout the examination. Furthermore, no evidence of abnormal bone growth was apparent following analysis within the sections.
