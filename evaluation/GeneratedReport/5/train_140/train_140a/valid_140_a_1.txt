The examination revealed no signs of occlusive pathology in the trachea and the lumens of both main bronchi. Unfortunately, the mediastinum could not be optimally assessed due to the non-contrast nature of the examination. However, the main vascular structures and the heart’s contours appeared to be normal in size. There was mild pericardial effusion and thickening noted. Calcific atheromatous plaques measuring less than a millimeter could be seen along the aortic arch. The thoracic esophagus maintained a normal calibration with no significant pathological wall thickening evident. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions. An evaluation of the lung parenchyma revealed moderate emphysematous changes along with sequelae of cystic alterations within the lung tissues. Additionally, old fracture lines were identified in the 6th, 7th, and 9th ribs on the right side, alongside non-specific subpleural changes displaying ground glass and reticular densities in the adjacent parenchyma. Furthermore, a progression of large specific nodules was observed in the lung tissues. There were no noted irregularities in the contours of the liver, which appeared normal, and the spleen was empty. Zodra ကိုင်သည်, significant cyst-growths presented within both kidneys. No spur formations or deformations were visible within the vertebral corpus or surrounding areas.
