The trachea and both main bronchi are patent, with no significant occlusive pathology identified. The thoracic esophagus shows no abnormal thickness, although there is a moderate sliding hiatal hernia at its junction. Due to insufficient IV contrast, the evaluation of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac features was suboptimal. However, calcified atheromas were noted in the ascending aorta, which exhibits an aneurysmal dilation measuring 38 mm. The heart’s shape and size are within normal limits, and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion or pleural thickening. Several enlarged lymph nodes were observed in both axillary regions, necessitating further investigation. Lung parenchyma evaluation revealed no active infiltration or significant masses in either lung; however, notable emphysematous changes were present in both lower lobes. There are signs of focal cystic bronchiectasis in the bronchial segments of both lungs, primarily affecting the right lung. Additionally, diffuse inflammation is mildly thickening the walls of the bronchi. Numerous small, benign nodules were identified bilaterally. Within the abdominal section observable through the non-contrast CT, a 30x25 mm solid mass was identified on the right adrenal gland, consistent with a low-density adenoma. Millerate-sized hyperdense calculi were present in both kidneys. No free intra-abdominal fluid or loculation was noted, and intra-abdominal lymph nodes appearing ضروریات were absent. Precise bony changes were outdated upon analysis.
