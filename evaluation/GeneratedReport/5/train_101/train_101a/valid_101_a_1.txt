The examination was conducted without the use of contrast, and the evaluation of mediastinal structures was noted as suboptimal. The trachea and the lumens of both main bronchi were unobstructed, without any signs of occlusive pathology. Mediastinal vascular structures appeared abnormal. Extensive calcific atherosclerotic changes were found in the thoracic abdominal artery but not in the coronary artery. The assessment indicated that heart size was normal, ruling out cardiomegaly. No pleural thickening or effusion was detected during the examination, and the esophagus was well-calibrated; significant pathological wall thickening was absent. There were no lymph nodes in the mediastinum or bilateral hilar regions displaying pathological characteristics. The lung parenchyma showed minimal peribronchial thickening distributed across both lungs, along with pulmonary emphysema noted bilaterally. Compared to previous exams, the number and size of nonspecific parenchymal nodules remained more resolute, with the largest measuring 6 mm in the left lung. Mass infiltration was detected in the lung parenchyma. Additionally, pleuroparenchymal sequelae and density increases occurred in the right lower lobe and the left lingular segment of the lungs. Bulla formations were prevalent in both lungs but primarily indicated scarring. In the upper abdominal views, findings were atypical for a non-contrast assessment, revealing complex findings related to the kidney. No significant lesions were noted in the bilateral adrenal glands, nor were any lytic-destructive bone lesions evident.
