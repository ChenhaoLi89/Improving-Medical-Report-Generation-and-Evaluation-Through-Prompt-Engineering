The trachea and both main bronchi were noted to be positioned in the midline, with no obstructive pathology found within the lumen. Although the mediastinum can't be evaluated thoroughly in the non-contrast examination, the mediastinal vascular structures appeared to be unusually calibrated. A notable calcification of the walls was identified in the thoracic-abdominal aorta and the coronary arteries, indicating possible disease. The heart size appears normal, with evidence of calcification noted in the mitral and aortic valves. There is a significant pericardial effusion. The thoracic esophagus shows abnormal calibration with signs of advanced tumoral wall thickening. No enlarged lymph nodes were detected across various regions, including prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and bilateral hilar-axillary areas, which are all deemed abnormal. Assessing the lung parenchyma shows minor peribronchial thickening distributed throughout both lungs while concerns about emphysematous changes exist solely in the right lung. There's a noticeable absence of bulla formations in either lung apex. Additionally, the right hemidiaphragm appears depressed. Increased pleuroparenchymal sequelae density is noted in the left lung only. There were no active lesions or infiltrative masses in either lung; the findings favor a malignancy. A simple cortical cyst measuring several millimeters is present in the right kidney's lower pole. Both adrenal glands are slightly enlarged without any significant lesions. No signs of osteoporosis were detected in bone structures, and vertebral corpus heights show significant flattening.
