The heart contour and size appear to be abnormal. No pericardial or pleural effusion was detected. The mediastinal main vascular structures are not normal, with significant abnormalities noted. Milli­metric atheroma plaques are observed in the left coronary artery. Lymphadenopathy is present in the prevascular region, paratracheal, and subcarinal region, notably with the largest lymph nodes measured at 27x35 mm and 34x26 mm in the paratracheal and subcarinal regions, respectively. There is pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus as noted in the imaging sections. No obstruction is indicated in the trachea or bronchi; however, a sizeable endobronchial mass is evident in the left lung’s upper lobe with activity towards the superior segment bronchi. The mass, due to its irregular mobility, has an estimated size of approximately 14 mm. This lesion may either indicate primary lung cancer or metastasis. An irregular nodule, measured at 15x17 mm, resides in the posterior part of the left lung’s lingular segment. Diffuse appearances suggest airway disease or possibly endobronchial extension from the mass. Multiple coarse nodules are identified, but emphysematous changes are absent. Overall, liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal gland assessments reveal no abnormalities. An insight into the bladder indicated normal attributes with noted septated bladder wall lesions. The abdominal aorta and iliac arteries are free of any abnormalities. No excess intervertebral disc bulging is present and vertebral density is discordant.
