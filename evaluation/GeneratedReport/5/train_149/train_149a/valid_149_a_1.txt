The trachea and both main bronchi appear clear, with no obstructive pathology noted. While the assessment of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac evaluation lacked clarity due to insufficient contrast, the calibration of mediastinal vessels, as well as the heart's contour and size, are considered abnormal. No pericardial effusion or thickening is present. The thoracic esophagus exhibits a slight increase in wall thickness without significant pathological changes. Mediastinal lymph nodes maintain normal size and structure, with the largest node measuring 8 mm in diameter at the precarinal level. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma, there are consolidation areas evident in the bilateral lower lobe superior segments and the anterior-apical segment of the right upper lobe, often linked to infectious processes (possibly indicating COVID-19?), warranting follow-up CT after treatment. Emphysematous changes are noted throughout both lungs, accompanied by fibrotic streaks in the right upper lobe's apical segment. Additionally, abdominal imaging reveals hyperdense nodules in both kidneys suggestive of masses (potentially tumors). There is a fusiform aneurysm of the abdominal aorta and a hypoense reduction indexed by end venography. Bone structures in the image do not show signs of lytic-destructive lesions, with preserved vertebral heights. However, there are no notable degenerative changes in the vertebral corpus associated with typical DISH.
