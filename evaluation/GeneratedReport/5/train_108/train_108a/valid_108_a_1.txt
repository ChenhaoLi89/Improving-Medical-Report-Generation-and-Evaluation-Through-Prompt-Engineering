The trachea and both main bronchi are patent with no obstructive pathology identified. A pathological increase in wall thickness is noted in the thoracic esophagus. The assessment of mediastinal vascular structures and heart anatomy was suboptimal due to the inadequate use of contrast. Calibration of the mediastinal vascular structures and the contours and size of the heart are unremarkable. Notably, edema and pleural effusion were observed. Calcified atheromatous plaques are present on the aortic walls and within the coronary arteries. Pathological lymph nodes are present in the axillary regions, supraclavicular region, and mediastinum. The examination of the lung parenchyma shows that both lungs are free of active infiltration or mass lesions. Mild bronchiectasis is observed in both lungs, particularly in the central regions. Emphysematous changes are observed, with increased severity noted in the lower lobes. There are areas of increased density resulting in structural degradation and volume loss primarily in both lung bases. A slight loss in height is evident in the upper endplate of the T3 vertebra within the scanned images, but the vertebraâ€™s anteroposterior diameter appears abnormal. The findings are assessed to favor malignant compression. The overall impression reveals minimal abnormalities, suggesting routine follow-up is appropriate.
