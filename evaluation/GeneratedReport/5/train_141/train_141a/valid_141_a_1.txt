The CT angiogram findings reveal that the mediastinal structures are normal, and no abnormalities are presented in the trachea or both main bronchi. The contour and size of the heart are within normal limits, and the diameter of the thoracic aorta is also reported as normal. There are significant signs of pericardial effusion-thickening noted in the report. Additionally, the thoracic esophagus appears dilated, and there is significant tumoral wall thickening detected. Enlarged lymph nodes are present in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions with pathological sizes being evidenced. The examination of the lung parenchyma showed that aeration is optimal, but nodular or infiltrative lesions are identified in the lung parenchyma. Significant pleural effusion-thickening is noted. An examination of the upper abdominal portions demonstrates a nodular mass that suggests a malignant growth adjacent to the spleen, which raises concern. Furthermore, there is a hyperdense lesion in the left kidney possibly consistent with cystic malignancy. Lastly, intense degeneration in the bone structures within the examined area has been observed, indicating advanced stages of arthritis which would require further evaluation and follow-up.
