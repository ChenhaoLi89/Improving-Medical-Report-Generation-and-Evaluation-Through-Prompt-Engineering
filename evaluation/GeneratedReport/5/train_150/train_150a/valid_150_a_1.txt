The trachea and both main bronchi are patent. The mediastinum shows normal vascular structures, and the heart’s contour and size are within normal limits. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is standard. There is clear evidence of pericardial effusion-thickening noted. The thoracic esophagus displays normal caliber with no significant tumoral wall thickening observed. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions remain within normal pathological limits. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma, several millimeter-sized specific subpleural nodules are identified in both lungs. Small, distinct patches of ground-glass opacity are noted in the right lower lobe’s inferior segment and the left lower lobe’s posterior segment, easily mistaken for adjacent parenchyma. It is essential to evaluate these findings primarily physiologically, with clinical laboratory correlations warranted and intensive follow-up recommended for any early signs of an infectious process. No nodular lesions are identifiable within both lung parenchyma, and there are no indications of pleural effusion-thickening. Abdominal examinations reveal no steatosis changes in liver parenchyma. The bilateral adrenal glands remain normal, and no space-occupying lesions are present. A 5 cm solid mass in the lower zone of the left kidney is observed. Bone structures are without abnormalities, and vertebral corpus heights are diminished.
