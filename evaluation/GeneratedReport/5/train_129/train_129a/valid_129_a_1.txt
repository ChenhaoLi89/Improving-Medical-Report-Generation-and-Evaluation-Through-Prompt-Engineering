The trachea was oriented to the left side of the main bronchi, and obstructive pathology was identified within the lumen. The mediastinum could not be assessed adequately in the non-contrast examination. In the views taken, mediastinal vessels were markedly dilated, and the heart's dimensions appeared abnormal. Evidence of pericardial effusion was noted with significant thickening. The thoracic esophagus exhibited abnormal calibration, and considerable pathological wall thickening was detected. A non-sliding type hiatal hernia was noticed at the upper end of the esophagus. Enlarged lymph nodes were observed in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary positions, exceeding pathological dimensions. Upon inspection of the lung parenchyma, multiple parenchymal nodules less than 10 mm in diameter were observed in the left lung. In contrast, numerous mass lesions with active infiltration displaying indefinite borders were detected in the right lung. The upper abdominal organs included within the examination were unremarkable. A significant space-occupying lesion was detected within the liver, appearing in the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were abnormal, and suspicious lesions were present. Severe scoliosis with right opening was detected on the thoracic level. Vertebral corpus heights are compromised.
