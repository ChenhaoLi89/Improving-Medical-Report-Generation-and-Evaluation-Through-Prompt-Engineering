The trachea and both main bronchi are patent. The mediastinal vascular structures and the contour of the heart appear abnormal, with noticeable enlargement. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is also within normal limits. No pericardial effusion or thickening was noted. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is abnormal, with significant tumoral wall thickening observed. Enlarged lymph nodes were found in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions exceeding pathological dimensions. When assessed in the lung parenchyma window, the aeration of both lung parenchyma is typical with no nodular or infiltrative lesions identified. There is no pleural effusion or associated thickening. Evaluation of the upper abdominal organs included in the imaging revealed abnormalities. There is a significant space-occupying lesion noted in the liver that extends into the cross-sectional area. The liver parenchyma shows diffuse changes consistent with steatosis. The bilateral adrenal glands are abnormal, revealing space-occupying lesions in multiple regions. The bone structures within the evaluation area are abnormal, with vertebral corpus heights showing significant compression changes. In conclusion, several parameters have deviated from the norm indicating various pathological findings requiring further evaluation and management.
