The trachea is located in the midline between both main bronchi, and no obstructive pathology is identified in the lumen. Although the mediastinum was not optimally evaluated during the non-contrasted examination, the visible mediastinal vascular structures and the contour of the heart appear normal. Notably, a significant pericardial effusion or wall thickening was found. The thoracic esophagus exhibits normal calibration, and no substantial tumoral wall thickening noted. A sliding type hiatal hernia is seen at the lower end of the esophagus. No enlarged lymph nodes at prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary areas with pathological dimensions were observed. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma window, changes indicative of pleuropneumonia were detected in the medial part of the middle lobe of the right lung; however, no mass lesion or distinct margins indicating active disorders were evident in either lung. The upper abdominal organs appear normal based on the scanned sections. No space-occupying lesions were identified in the liver or among the adrenal glands, both of which appear completely devoid of such lesions. Notably, while some degenerative changes are present in the bone structures within the examination area, they are extensive in nature, contrasting the previously minimal findings. Ultimately, there are no signs of advanced pathology detected throughout this examination.
