The trachea and both main bronchi appear occluded. The mediastinal main vascular structures and the heart's contour and size are abnormal. Noticeable pericardial effusion with thickening was observed. The thoracic esophagus shows significant pathological wall thickening with abnormal calibration noted. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and subcarinal regions, as well as in bilateral hilar and axillary areas, are detected and noted to be concerning. Upon examining the lung parenchyma window, a 5 mm diameter specific pulmonary nodule in the left lung lower lobe laterobasal segment and an expansive area of atelectasis unrelated to this nodule are observed. There are no millimetric pulmonary nodules in either lung without local calcification. The upper abdominal organs included in the sections appear abnormal. A significant space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver occupying the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands were abnormal, and large space-occupying lesions were noted. The bone structures in the study area are not natural. Vertebral corpus heights show significant collapses. Overall, the findings suggest several pathological conditions requiring close monitoring and possibly further investigation.
