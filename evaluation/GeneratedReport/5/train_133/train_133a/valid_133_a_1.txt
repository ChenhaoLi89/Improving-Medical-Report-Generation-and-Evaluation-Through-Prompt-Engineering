The evaluation of the mediastinal and cardiac structures was constrained due to the absence of IV contrast. The mediastinal major vascular structures were found to be abnormal, with irregular contours observed in the heart size. Interestingly, thickening of the pericardial effusion was noted. Both the trachea and the primary bronchi are reported to be closed, and occlusive pathology was identified in the lumen. Normal calibration of the thoracic esophagus is contingent upon pathological wall thickening, which was absent upon evaluation. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were detected in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and subcarinal regions, as well as bilateral hilar-axillary areas. Evaluation of the lung parenchyma revealed that the aeration was heterogenous, with the identification of nodular and infiltrative lesions within the lung parenchyma. Pleural effusion-thickening was explicitly detected. Examination of the upper abdominal organs revealed concerning abnormalities. A space-occupying lesion was noted in the liver that was significant enough to alter the cross-sectional area analyzed. The bilateral adrenal glands appeared to be abnormal as space-occupying lesions were detected. The bone structures in the study area are described as either natural or abnormal. Some irregularities were detected in the vertebral bodies, with alterations in their heights observed during the examination.
