The trachea and both main bronchi are occluded. Significant vascular constriction is identified in the aorta and coronary arteries. Other structures within the mediastinum, including the contours and size of the heart, exhibit abnormalities. A pericardial effusion was notably identified. The thoracic esophagus shows marked stricture and considerable tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were detected in multiple regions, including prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary areas. Assessment of the lung parenchyma reveals extensive scar tissue formation in the upper lobes of both lungs, with clear usual interstitial pneumonia patterns. A focal consolidation in the anterior segment of the left lung's upper lobe suggests recent COVID-19 infection. Multiple prominent pulmonary lesions are seen in the posterior segment of the left lung upper lobe, signaling an infectious process. Severe emphysema appears in both lungs while abnormalities are found in the upper abdominal organs. Notably, a significant mass was identified in the liver extending across the cross-sectional area. The right adrenal gland shows irregularities accompanied by a potential serpiginous lesion noted. Osteosclerotic changes have occurred in the thoracic vertebrae without alarming geometric alterations, while contrary tapering processes in the cervical spine rising prominently are noted. Consolidation of knowledge from prior examinations is essential for comprehensive assessment, and if clinically indicated, advance imaging techniques such as cervical MR scans are crucial for diagnosing cervical metastasis.
