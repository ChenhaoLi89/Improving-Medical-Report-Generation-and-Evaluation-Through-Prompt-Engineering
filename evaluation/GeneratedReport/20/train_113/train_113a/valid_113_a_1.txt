The CTO measurement falls outside the normal range. The calibration of the main mediastinal vascular structures appears abnormal. Thymic tissue in the anterior mediastinum has a wound shape configuration and is causing mild mass effect, with hyperdense areas present, likely related to active mitotic processes. Lymph nodes of significant size and irregular configuration were detected within the mediastinum. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were also identified at the hilar regions. The left hemithorax shows considerable asymmetry. The calibration of the trachea and main bronchi is compromised with areas of obstruction, and their lumens are distinguished by a thick mucous lining. Significant tumoral wall thickening of the thoracic esophagus was noted. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were observed in the prevascular and paratracheal regions, as well as bilateral hilar-axillary areas. Upon evaluation of the lung parenchyma window, a 2 mm diameter nodule with specific attributes typically related to inflammation was present bilaterally. Also, a nodule of 3 mm was fully calcified. There were findings consistent with pneumonia in both lungs. Inspection of the upper abdominal organs revealed density associated with 3 mm diameter cysts in the lower part of the right kidney. The adrenal glands were found to be planar with the detection of a substantial space-occupying lesion. Significant degenerative changes were conspicuously observed in the vertebrae.
