The trachea and both main bronchi are partially occluded. The mediastinal main vascular structures and the contour of the heart appear abnormal in size. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is significantly enlarged. A moderate pericardial effusion with marked thickening was observed. Calibration of the thoracic esophagus shows considerable abnormality, and significant tumoral wall thickening has been identified. Enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, all presenting with pathological dimensions. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma, there is markedly reduced aeration in both lungs, and multiple nodular lesions and infiltrative patches were discovered in the lung parenchyma. Pleural thickening and some effusions were observed. The upper abdominal organs evaluated appear mostly abnormal, with significant lesions detected in the liver. The liver parenchyma does not show diffuse changes suggestive of steatosis. The bilateral adrenal glands exhibited abnormal growths, with several space-occupying lesions present. Bone structures in the area under study show unusual characteristics. The heights of the vertebral corpus are significantly reduced. Overall, significant abnormalities were identified across studied systems, requiring continued observation and possible intervention.
