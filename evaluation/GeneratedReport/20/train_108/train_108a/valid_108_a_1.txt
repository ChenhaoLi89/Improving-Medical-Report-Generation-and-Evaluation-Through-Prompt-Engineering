The trachea and both main bronchi are obstructed, showing significant occlusive pathology. A pathological increase in wall thickness is noted in the thoracic esophagus. The assessment of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac evaluation was performed successfully without the contrast agent. The calibration of mediastinal vessels reveals altered structures, with the heart exhibiting an abnormal contour and size. There is substantial pericardial effusion present, along with notable pleural effusion. Large, non-calcified vascular lesions are found on the aortic walls and coronary arteries. Pathological lymph nodes were detected in abnormally sized conditions in the axillary regions and supraclavicular areas, extending into the mediastinum. Further analysis of the lung parenchyma revealed significant active infiltrations and a pronounced mass lesion in both lungs. Extensive bronchiectasis is present throughout both lungs, specifically in the peripheral zones. Emphysema is neither noted in the lungs nor particularly pronounced in the lower lobes. Dense areas are observed causing significant structural distortion and volume gain in the lung bases, particularly in anterior sections. There is a notable increase in height at the upper plateau of the T3 vertebra. The vertebral corpus reveals an irregular anteroposterior diameter. The overall appearance was evaluated unfavorably, highlighting malignant compression.
