The heart size and contour appear abnormal with mild cardiomegaly. Notable pleural or pericardial effusion was present. Main vascular structures in the mediastinum show significant abnormalities. Atheroma plaques are substantially larger in the right coronary artery, with criticisms of their characteristics. Lymphadenopathies are absent in the prevascular, paratracheal, and subcarinal regions. The largest mediastinal lymphadenopathy is approximately 10x15 mm in size. There is marked pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus within the sections assessed. Occlusive pathology is identified in both the trachea and the main bronchi. Additionally, an endobronchial mass is observed in the right lung upper lobe. This mass shows a slight extension towards surrounding structures, with dimensions around 20 mm. This finding is confidently attributed to benign etiology. There are no distinct nodules observed in the posterior section of the lungs. Lung clearances appear normal, and significant infection is suspected due to minor changes across both lungs. The liver appears enlarged, exhibiting significant lesions and troubling vascular irregularities in both the hepatic and portal venous systems. The gallbladder shows abnormalities without any discernable disturbance to the kidneys, which are also incapable of maximal dilation. The bladder wall is normal, and no thickness increase was detected. A unremarkable prostate gland contains features suggestive of mild enlargement. Pockets of free fluid collection within the abdominal cavity are noted, along with vertebral height diminishing, indicating compensatory changes.
