No significant occlusive pathology was noted in the trachea and the lumens of both main bronchi. However, no wall calcifications were consistently detected in the trachea or bronchi. A non-contrast assessment provided an optimal evaluation of the mediastinal structures. The anterior-posterior diameter of the ascending aorta measured 50 mm, whereas the descending aorta was noted at 28 mm. The calibration of the pulmonary arteries was abnormal. Heart size was recorded as normal. Pericardial thickening was present but classified as mild. There were no signs of atherosclerotic calcifications in the thoracic aorta or coronary arteries. The aortic valve was reported as being normal. Upon examination, the thoracic esophagus revealed significant wall thickening with associated pathology. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular and hilar regions were observed, which had pathological dimensions and raised concerns. Motion artifacts prevented clear assessment, leading to a finding of normal lung segments, with no evidence of changes in the right middle lobe or left lingual area. Subpleural adipose tissue was not observed. Investigations revealed no mass lesions with distinguishable borders within the lungs. The assessment of upper abdominal organs indicated abnormal findings. No lesions were discovered in the liver or adrenal glands, which were atypical. Bony lesions presenting with spur formations were not present in any vertebrae. No Schmorl nodules were identified throughout the thoracic vertebral end plates.
