The findings from the examination indicate that the CTO is abnormal. The trachea, as well as both main bronchi, appear obstructed. Both mediastinal main vascular structures and the heart size present findings that are atypical. Additionally, the diameter of the thoracic aorta is enlarged. A significant pericardial effusion and thickening have been noted. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is abnormal, and there are signs of serious tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, exhibiting pathological dimensions. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma in the appropriate window, aeration of both lung parenchyma is severely compromised, with several nodular and infiltrative lesions noted. Moderate pleural effusion and thickening have been observed. Regarding the upper abdominal organs referenced in the scans, a nodular formation possibly identifying an accessory spleen has been located adjacent to the spleen. Additionally, there is no hypodense lesion detected in the left kidney, contrary to suggestions of a cortical cyst. Significant degenerative changes were absent in the bone structures within the areas examined. This report reveals abnormalities that should be further investigated with appropriate clinical correlation and additional imaging as warranted.
