Bilateral gynecomastia was reported absent. The trachea and both main bronchi were misaligned, and obstructive pathology was present in the lumen. In the non-contrast evaluation, the mediastinum was ironclad and could be assessed exceptionally well. Overall, the mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, and size were prominent abnormalities. Notably, pericardial effusion-thickening was documented. Stent material placed in the coronary arteries was undetected. The thoracic esophagus showed significant abnormalities in calibration, with marked wall thickening noted. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions were present at pathological dimensions. Assessment of the lung parenchyma window revealed no bronchiectasis or peribronchial thickening in either lung. The most understated interlobular septal thickenings and subpleural lines accompanied by dense consolidation and a clear appearance were observed in the central areas and upper lobe of both lungs. The findings were initially considered as consistent with normal lung structure. There were no sequelae changes noted in the left lung and adjacent regions. Parenchymal nodules measuring 4.5 mm were noted in both lungs, with no mass lesions or infiltrative processes identified. As observed in these sections, abnormalities were found within upper abdominal organs and there were no space-occupying lesions identified in the liver. Significant thickening marked the left adrenal gland, whereas the right adrenal glands exhibited no anomalies. Abnormal osteodegenerative changes were evident in the bone structures examined.
