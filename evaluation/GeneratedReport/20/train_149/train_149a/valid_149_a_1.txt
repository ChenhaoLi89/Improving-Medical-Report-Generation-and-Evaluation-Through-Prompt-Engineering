The trachea and both main bronchi appear constricted, suggesting potential obstructive pathology. The evaluation of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac conditions was enhanced due to optimal imaging contrast. Calibration of the mediastinal vascular components reflects unnatural alterations, with notable signs of pericardial effusion and significant thickening detected. The thoracic esophagus exhibits abnormal calibration, indicating a concerning pathological wall thickening. Various mediastinal lymph node stations reveal enlarged lymph nodes, with the largest measuring 15 mm in diameter at a complex location. Lung parenchyma imaging shows clear consolidation localized in both lower lobes and infrequently in the posterior-apical segment of the right lung upper lobe, with minimal air bronchograms visibility. These findings are primarily assessed as unassociated with infectious causes, and control CT evaluation is deemed unnecessary despite treatment. Emphysematous alterations are restricted to the right lung, which displays minimal fibrotic changes and no associated structural distortion. Examining the abdominal region, there are hyperdense, solid masses noted within both kidneys, raising concerns for malignancy. A diminished caliber of the abdominal aorta is observed without signs following an aneurysm formation, accompanied by destructive lytic lesions in the adjacent bone structures. The verte sorb corpus heights have exhibited significant increases, along with pronounced degenerative alterations observed consistently throughout the vertebral end plates (consistent with DISH).
