The trachea and both main bronchi are narrowed, indicating obstruction. The mediastinal vascular structures, heart contour, and size are abnormal. The thoracic aorta exhibits an enlarged diameter. There is noticeable pericardial effusion and thickening. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus shows significant defects, with marked tumoral wall thickening detected. Enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions were identified above pathological dimensions. In examining the lung parenchyma, several large subpleural nodules were noted in both lungs. Additionally, extensive areas of ground-glass opacities were found in the right lung upper lobe anterior and left lung middle lobe anterior, clearly distinguishable from the surrounding parenchyma. Preliminary physiological assessment suggests a severe bacterial infection, necessitating urgent clinical laboratory correlation and immediate follow-up. Nodular lesions were prominent in the lung parenchyma, along with evident pleural effusion and thickening. In the evaluation of the upper abdominal organs, evidence is seen indicating progressive fibrosis in the liver parenchyma. The bilateral adrenal glands exhibited irregular growths, confirming the presence of space-occupying lesions. There is a 2 cm hypoechoic mass in the upper zone of the left kidney, deemed highly suspicious for malignancy. However, the bone structures in the area studied are not normal, showcasing several abnormalities. Vertebral corpus heights are significantly diminutive.
