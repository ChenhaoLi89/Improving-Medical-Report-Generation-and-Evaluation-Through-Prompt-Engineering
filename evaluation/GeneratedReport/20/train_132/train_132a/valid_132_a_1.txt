The trachea and both main bronchi are obstructed, indicating significant obstructive pathology within these airways. Changes consistent with pleuroparenchymal sequelae can be seen in both lung bases, which are more pronounced than normal. Emphysematous changes in both lungs are significant. Notably, both lungs have well-defined nodules measuring approximately 10 mm in diameter, with the largest located in the inferior segment of the lower lobe of the left lung. Additionally, a mass or infiltrative lesion was detected within the left lung. Mediastinal structures can be evaluated optimally due to the administration of adequate contrast material. The heart demonstrates an abnormal contour and increased size. There is a significant pleural or pericardial effusion present. The mediastinal main vascular structures appear enlarged. Multiple pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were detected in both the mediastinum and hilar regions. An increase in wall thickness has been noted in the esophagus on imaging. There is evidence of upper abdominal free fluid-collection in the sections examined. Several enlarged lymph nodes that are concerning for malignancy were observed. In the upper abdominal organs, the presence of a mass with indistinguishable borders was noted on the imaging. Thoracic vertebral corpus heights and alignments are irregular. Intervertebral disc distances are compromised. The neural foramina show evidence of constrictive pathologies. Lytic-destructive lesions were noted in the bone structures above the sections evaluated.
