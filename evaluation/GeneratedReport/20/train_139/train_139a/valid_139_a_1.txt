The trachea and both main bronchi are narrowed, indicating potential obstruction. The mediastinal vascular structures and heart contour appear distorted and are larger than normal. In the pericardial area, there is no effusion present, ruling out any significant fluid accumulation. The thoracic esophagus shows marked dilation, and significant pathological wall thickening is evident. Several enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, indicating potential malignancy. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window, aeration of both lungs is diminished, and multiple nodular and infiltrative lesions are identified within the lung tissue. Additionally, pleural effusion and thickening are observed. The upper abdominal organs analyzed show abnormal findings, raising concerns for underlying pathology. A significant space-occupying lesion is present in the liver that enters the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands are abnormal due to a notable lesion detected. Bone structures in the evaluated area show signs of degeneration, and vertebral corpus heights are not preserved. Overall, further assessment and intervention are warranted based on these findings to address the suspected conditions identified in this report, ensuring a thorough diagnostic approach.
