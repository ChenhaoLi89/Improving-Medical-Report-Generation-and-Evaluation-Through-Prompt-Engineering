The CTO is abnormal with an ascending aorta calibration of 35 mm, which is narrower than usual. The descending aorta appears to be normal. The aortic arch measures 28 mm, falling within normal limits. Calibration of the other mediastinal vascular structures presents with slight abnormalities. No catheter appearance is found in the superior vena cava. Instead, calcific atheroma plaques are seen only in the aortic arch and not in the coronary arteries. Several lymph nodes of pathological sizes were detected in the mediastinum, indicating potential concerns. Notably, normal thoracic esophageal calibration is present, yet significant tumoral wall thickening is detected. In lung examination via the parenchyma window, both the trachea and main bronchi exhibit thickening in the main segments, and there is no prominence in the right middle lobe or left lingular segment. Sequelae changes and noticeable increases in density are observed at the apical level and seemingly absent in the lower lobe. A stable, unchanged nodule measuring approximately 4 mm is documented in the left lung's inferior lingular segment. Additionally, the gallbladder appears normal and shows no signs of distention. Cortical contours are smooth. There are no calcific atheroma plaques present in the abdominal aorta or in other regions. Lastly, significant degenerative changes and severe lytic areas in the bone structure raising no concern about fractures were noted in alignment with previous reviews.
