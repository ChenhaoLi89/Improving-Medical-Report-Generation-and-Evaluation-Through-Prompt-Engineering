The trachea and both main bronchi are partially collapsed. The mediastinal vascular structures show abnormalities, and the heart size and contour are distorted. The thoracic aorta diameter is widened. Evidence of pericardial effusion and thickening is noted. No calcific plaques are monitored in the coronary arteries. The thoracic esophagus is substantially enlarged, and significant tumoral wall thickening is present. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions exhibit pathological dimensions. In the evaluation of lung parenchyma, there are significant bronchiectasis present throughout both lungs. Infiltration is evident in the lung parenchyma, and pleural effusion-thickening appears. Investigating the upper abdominal organs reveals no localized density loss in the liver. Large gallstones are visible in the gallbladder. Osteophytes in the thoracic vertebrae are absent, and no significant fibrotic densities are observed in the surrounding lung parenchyma. Hence, the assessment indicates moderately severe complications in the thoraco-abdominal region, with various structural abnormalities identified that warrant further investigation. Careful monitoring and follow-up exams may be essential to understand the underlying causes of these findings.
