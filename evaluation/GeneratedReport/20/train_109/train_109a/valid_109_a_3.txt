The examination revealed the presence of lymph nodes in both the supraclavicular fossa and axilla, of significant pathological size and typical appearance. The sternotomy line remains intact, and the findings from the prior Bypass operation indicate no change. There is no evidence of pleural effusion present (postoperative), and the size of the heart appears unchanged. You will find atypical mediastinal lymph nodes scattered in the mediastinum. Upon assessing the lung parenchyma window, no pleural effusion was found between the left pleural leaves. Additionally, lung tissue appeared normal with no signs of compression atelectasis adjacent to lungs. No pneumonia or consolidative areas were detected in the lung parenchyma. Areas of suspicious nodules or mass-occupying lesions were noted in the aerated lung parenchyma. Further evaluation of the upper abdominal regions revealed noticeable alterations, presenting indications of acute inflammation. Features explicitly showcase accelerated degenerative changes in both muscular and bony structures of the thorax. In summary, while there is no current evidence of serous effusion, significant mediastinal lymph nodes referenced earlier may require future surveillance due to physiological changes noted throughout the thoracic region. Correct assessment of the lungs confirms overall health, disputing earlier claims of pathology.
