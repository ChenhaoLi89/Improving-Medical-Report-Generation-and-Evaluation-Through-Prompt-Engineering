The trachea was found deviated towards the left main bronchus, and obstructive pathology was present in the lumen. The mediastinum was adequately assessed in the non-contrast examination. The mediastinal vascular structures appeared abnormal with a distinctly irregular heart contour and size. Notably, pericardial effusion and thickening were recorded. The thoracic esophagus exhibited abnormal calibration, with significant pathological wall thickening detected. A large paraesophageal hernia was noted at the lower end of the esophagus. Enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar areas, exceeding pathological dimensions. Upon examining the lung parenchyma window, several expansive parenchymal lesions, greater than 5 mm in diameter, were noted in both lungs. Additionally, active infiltration with indistinguishable borders was also present in the lung fields. Evaluation of upper abdominal organs revealed substantial pathology, including a mass lesion documented in the liver region. The bilateral adrenal glands exhibited extreme abnormality, with substantial space-occupying lesions identified. No deformities were present, and the vertebral morphology was noticeably compromised at the thoracic level. Moderate scoliosis towards the right opening was observed, with vertebral corpus heights markedly reduced. Overall, significant abnormalities throughout multiple structural domains were noted.
