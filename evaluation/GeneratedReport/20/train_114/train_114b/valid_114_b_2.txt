The imaging report indicates the presence of a port chamber on the anterior chest wall, with the catheter extending into the inferior vena cava. The trachea and both main bronchi were displaced to the left, and the lumen exhibited significant obstructive pathology. Due to the non-contrast evaluation, assessing the mediastinum proved suboptimal. The mediastinal vascular structures and heart size appear abnormal, with evidence of pericardial effusion and thickening noted. The thoracic esophagus exhibited significant wall thickening, and enlarged lymph nodes consistent with pathological dimensions were found in pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar regions. When analyzing the lung parenchyma window, several centimeter-sized distinct parenchymal nodules were identified in both lungs, along with sizable mass lesions and pneumatic infiltration. Closer observation of sections active within the thoracic cavity indicates abnormal findings in upper abdominal organs. The liver show multiple space-occupying lesions within the cross-sectional area. Both adrenal glands presented abnormalities, demonstrating enlarged masses present within them. Bone structures throughout the relevant study section present abnormalities, with reduced vertebral corpus heights. In-depth evaluation of intra-abdominal solid organs was conducted using contrast-enhanced imaging, which showed unexpected pathological findings. Notably, evidence of compromise within the enterohepatic axis was also recorded, highlighting a significant cause for further inquiry.
