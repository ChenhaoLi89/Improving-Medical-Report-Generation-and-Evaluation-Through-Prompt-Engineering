A triangular density consistent with an expanded thymic remnant is noted in the anterior mediastinum. The trachea and main bronchi appear obstructed. Additionally, multiple pathological lymphadenopathy (LAP) was identified throughout the mediastinum. The cardiothoracic index is abnormal. Significant pleural effusion and thickening were found in both hemithoraces. Upon evaluating both lung parenchyma, three nonspecific nodules measuring 4 mm in the middle lobe of the right lung and 3 mm in the posterobasal segment of the lower lobe are present. In the images assessed through the upper section of the abdomen, both adrenal glands show signs of pathology, suggesting enlargement. Importantly, a significant congenital abnormality was observed in the abdominal cavity. Lytic-destructive lesions were noted in the bony structures, raising concerns for possible malignancy. There is now an impression of vascular abnormalities surrounding the lung vasculature. Furthermore, no airspace opacities were found, indicating a high likelihood of healthy lung tissue. The evaluation suggests a careful follow-up to monitor the observed lung findings and any potential adrenal pathologies with further imaging warranted. A cross-check recommended with consults regarding the bone abnormalities as well. Overall, this report necessitates a comprehensive evaluation for further diagnostics and tailored therapeutic interventions.
