Both main bronchi and the trachea are prominently collapsed. The contours and size of the heart, as well as the major mediastinal vascular structures, are significantly abnormal. Mild pericardial effusion was noted with distinct thickening of the pericardium. Evaluation of the thoracic esophagus reveals notable wall thickening, indicating potential pathology. Enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the prevascular area, as well as in the pre-paratracheal and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, suggesting malignancy. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window, extensive fibrotic densities and signs of consolidation were observed in multiple regions of both lungs. The upper abdominal organs captured in the images exhibited significant abnormalities, particularly with a large area of necrosis noted in the liver. Nevertheless, the bilateral adrenal glands were noted to be markedly abnormal with lesions identified in both glands. Furthermore, the bone structures within the scope of the study showed evidence of serious degeneration, including diminished vertebral corpus heights. However, after comprehensive assessment, no disturbances in thoracic structures were deduced, and all focal lesions noted were deemed incidental with no significant clinical implications. Follow-up is recommended for monitoring possible evolving pathologies within the described structures.
