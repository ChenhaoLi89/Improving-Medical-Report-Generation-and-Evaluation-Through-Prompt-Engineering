The examination revealed no obstructive pathology within the trachea and both main bronchi. Mediastinal evaluation was adequately performed during the non-contrast study, demonstrating that the major vascular structures and heart contour appear abnormal. There was an observed pericardial effusion causing substantial thickening. No atherosclerotic changes were noted in the thoracic vessels, and the aortic valve was found to be normal. Affected areas of the distal esophagus presented a smooth surface with 6.7 mm wall thickness over a length of 5.9 cm at the junction; however, no significant paraesophageal lymph nodes were identified. Some tiny relevant lymph nodes were noted with a combined size of 9x5.5 mm. The lung parenchyma represented no findings suggestive of significant damage. Some centrilobular emphysema were detected only in the left lung with no patterns established in lower lobe bases or hisecting parts of either lung. Furthermore, bronchial walls within the lungs were reported normal without thickening or narrowing. Findings documented calcified nodules that reached sizes near 6.9x5.5 mm but presented at unusual locations. Evaluation against previous studies was deemed unnecessary. No significant lesions or increased echogenicity was noted. The upper abdominal organs did, however, show some abnormalities, including a space-occupying lesion in the liver. Right adrenal gland anomaly was found also while a gallbladder stone measuring 1 cm was observed. Bone structures appeared to have considerable deformities with preserved vertebral height loss.
