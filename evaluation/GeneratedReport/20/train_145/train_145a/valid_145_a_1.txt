The trachea and both main bronchi appear obstructed. The mediastinum was evaluated optimally in the non-contrast examination. The mediastinal vascular structures and heart contour demonstrated abnormalities. The thoracic aorta is noted to have an enlarged diameter. Pericardial effusion-thickening was observed. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus was abnormal, revealing significant tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes exhibiting pathological dimensions were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Examination of the lung parenchyma window indicates that aeration of both lung parenchyma is compromised, with nodular lesions detected. There was, however, the presence of diffuse pulmonary thickening. The evaluations of upper abdominal organs displayed abnormalities. A significant space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver invading the cross-sectional area, and both adrenal glands showed signs of pathology, indicating the existence of lesions. In addition, calcifications were observed throughout the right kidney. Bone structures within the study area appeared abnormal, and vertebral corpus heights are significantly compromised. Demarcations in both proximal and distal aspects reflect degenerative changes. Further imaging may be necessary to clarify these findings. The overall assessment suggests potential underlying complications necessitating further evaluation.
