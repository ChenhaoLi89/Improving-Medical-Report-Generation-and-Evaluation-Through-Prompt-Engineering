The evaluation was significantly hampered by the position of mediastinal vascular structures, and a comprehensive cardiac assessment could not be conducted with the available imaging. The mediastinal main vascular structures exhibited irregularities, and the heart contour was found to be abnormal in size. There was notable pericardial effusion-thickening observed. The evaluation of the trachea and both main bronchi indicated partial occlusion in the lumen. The thoracic esophagus exhibited abnormal calibration and significant pathological wall thickening was detected. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma, the aeration showed areas of reduced function, and infiltrative lesions were present in the lung tissue. Additionally, pleural effusion-thickening was noted. The assessment of the upper abdominal organs identified abnormalities. A space-occupying lesion was observed in the liver that encroached upon the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands displayed signs of disease and a significant space-occupying lesion was found. Overall, the bone structures were abnormal in the study area, showing compressive fractures. The vertebral corpus heights demonstrated significant loss.
