The examination was performed without contrast, and the mediastinal structures were evaluated as optimal. The trachea and lumen of both main bronchi are not open, and occlusive pathology was detected in these areas. The major vascular structures in the mediastinum exhibited significant abnormalities. Calcific atherosclerotic changes were noted in the walls of the thoracic abdominal artery, but not in the coronary artery. Heart size was found to be within normal limits, indicating no cardiomegaly. Pleural effusion and thickening were observed. The esophagus demonstrated significant pathological wall thickening, and normal calibration was found only in certain sections of the examination. Enlarged lymph nodes were detected in mediastinal and bilateral hilar areas, suggesting potential pathology. Minimal peribronchial thickening and extensive emphysematous changes were assessed in both lung parenchyma. Compared to the previous examination, an increase in size and number of nonspecific parenchymal nodules was indicated, contradicting previous findings. A mass-infiltration was detected in both lung parenchymas. Pleuroparenchymal sequelae noted increased density in the lower lobe of the left lung and the anterior segment of the right lung. Bulla formations were observed primarily in the lower sections of the lungs, recognized as definitive cysts. The upper abdominal sections were excessively focused on non-contrast findings, revealing a prominent complicated cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney. Assessment of bilateral adrenal glands showed anomalies, and significant space-occupying lesions were identified. No specific bone abnormality was observed.
