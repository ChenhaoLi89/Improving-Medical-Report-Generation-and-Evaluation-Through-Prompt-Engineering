The trachea and main bronchi appeared deviated from the midline, with obstructive pathology evident in the lumen. The mediastinum was evaluated optimally in the non-contrast examination. The main vascular structures in the mediastinum seemed abnormal. There were no calcifications found in the thoracic-abdominal aorta or in the coronary arteries. The heart size was assessed to be normal. The mitral valve and aortic valve were noted to be without calcification. Thickening of pericardial fluid detection was remarkable. The thoracic esophagus was shown to have significant tumor wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary dimensions. In the lung parenchyma evaluation; significant peribronchial thickening was absent in both lungs. No emphysematous changes were recorded, and there were no bulla formations noted. The left hemidiaphragm was described as normal in elevation. No significant density increases related to pleuroparenchymal sequelae were detected in either lung. Mass lesions or active infiltrations were present within both lungs. A complex cyst was favored over a simple cyst as the better diagnosis. Additionally, a papillary cyst was discovered in the mid-section of the left kidney. The bilateral adrenal glands were noted to have space-occupying lesions. Osteopenia was observed instead of osteoporosis in bone structures, and vertebral corpus heights are diminished.
