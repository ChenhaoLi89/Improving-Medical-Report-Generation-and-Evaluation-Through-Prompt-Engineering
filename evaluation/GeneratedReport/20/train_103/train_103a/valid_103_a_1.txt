The trachea and the proximal lumen of both main bronchi exhibit significant occlusion. Several occlusive pathologies were identified within the trachea and both bronchi. The mediastinal structures were found to be well-evaluated, showing excellent enhancement. Notably, the calibration of thoracic main vascular structures appears to be abnormal. Contrary to previous assessments, the heart size was noted to be diminished. Pericardial effusion was present but did not exhibit significant thickening. There was no indication of prosthetic material in the aortic valve, and while healthy tissue was identified along the wall of the ascending aorta, no post-operative suture materials were present. The thoracic esophagus showed abnormal calibration with noticeable significant wall thickening. Lymph nodes were unremarkable, measuring well below clinically relevant thresholds in the lower paratracheal and subcarinal areas. The imaging examination revealed no ground-glass opacities, nor any indication of consolidation, contradicting an infectious process scenario. Interseptal thickenings were absent across all lobes. Thick free fluid was noted only on the left side between the pleural layers, with a measurement of 10 mm, and the right noted an extensive dry space. The lung parenchyma demonstrated healthy modifications without emphysematous changes or significant lesions. Upper abdominal sections analyzed did not show any abnormalities. There were no indications of metal burials in the sternal area, and all surrounding bone structures displayed new lytic lesions.
