A mass measuring 4 cm is noted in the thin region of the left lung, which partially surrounds the pleura at its base. Several areas of effusion, measuring 45 mm at their thickest point, display no loculation on the left between the pleural leaves. In the lower lobe of the left lung, reticular density decreases with smooth borders and was assessed as indicative of fibrotic changes. Furthermore, there are consolidation areas in the upper lobe with clear bronchial distinctions and healthy lung tissue. Irregular thickenings are seen in the mediastinal and jugular pleura. Soft tissue densities found in the upper paratracheal area measure approximately 30x25 mm without necrotic changes, accompanied by a solitary lymph node. In addition, there is a single lymphadenopathy in the upper paratracheal, subcarinal paraesophageal, and center-left areas, the largest of which measures 2 cm on the axial plane. Significant emphysema is present in only the upper lobe of the right lung, while there is no evidence of parenchymal disc degeneration or fluid collection within the lungs at all. Millimetric parenchymal nodules are present in the middle and lower lobes of the left lung. A 7 mm diameter nodule was described in the upper lobe of the right lung. Among the abdominal sections assessed, lymphadenopathies showed no measurable size concerning the renal arteries. Bone structures demonstrate abnormalities. Vertebral disc heights are heavily decreased.
