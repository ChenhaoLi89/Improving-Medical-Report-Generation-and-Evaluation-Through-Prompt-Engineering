The trachea is positioned slightly to the right of both main bronchi, with notable obstructive pathology seen within the lumen. The mediastinum was effectively evaluated in the contrast examination. The mediastinal vascular structures and heart size appear abnormal. Pericardial effusion and thickening were present. The thoracic esophagus showed notable calibration abnormalities alongside significant wall thickening. A sliding type hiatal hernia was not observed at the lower end of the esophagus. Enlarged lymph nodes were identified in multiple areas, including prevascular and subcarinal spaces, with a notable size. Within the lung parenchyma window; the medial part of the middle lobe of the left lung showed pleuroparenchymal fibroatelectasis without previous damage.  An inconspicuous mass lesion with distinguishable borders was detected in the left lung. The upper abdominal organs demonstrate significant abnormalities across visible sections. A prominent space-occupying lesion was identified in the liver located in the cross-sectional area. The right adrenal gland showed atypical findings while bilateral adrenal glands appear selectively abnormal regarding space-occupying characteristics. Excessive degenerative changes were not noted in the bone structures within the evaluated area. Despite these aspects, overall cautions observed suggest benign follow-up without immediate invasive interventions required at this time.
