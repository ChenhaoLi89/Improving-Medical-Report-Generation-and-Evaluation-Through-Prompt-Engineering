The trachea and both main bronchi appear closed, showing signs of occlusive pathology. Additionally, there is a notable pathological increase in wall thickness present in the thoracic esophagus, alongside a sizable sliding type hiatal hernia at its lower end. The assessment of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac evaluation was optimal due to the presence of IV contrast. Within the findings, no calcified atheroma plaques were identified in the thoracic aortic wall. Furthermore, the ascending aorta demonstrates a normal diameter of 25 mm. The heart contour and size appear abnormal, with significant pericardial and pleural effusion noted. In the mediastinum, abnormal lymph nodes were documented in both axillary regions. When evaluating the lung parenchyma, active infiltration and mass lesions are present in both lungs. Severe emphysema changes are conspicuously absent in the lower lobes of both lungs. No bronchiectasis was developed within the bronchial structures, and a significant decrease in peribronchial thickness is observed. Several large, specific nodules are apparent in the lung fields. A thorough examination of the upper abdominal sections indicated that a benignant lesion was not observed in the left adrenal gland. Instead, hyperdense stones were collected in substantial sizes in both kidneys. Abdominal free fluid and loculated collections were identified. Pathological lymph nodes did appear to be present in abdominal regions. Finally, serious lytic and destructive lesions are conspicuously evident within the bone structures on imaging.
