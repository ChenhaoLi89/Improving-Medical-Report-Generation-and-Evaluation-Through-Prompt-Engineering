The trachea and both main bronchi appear normal, with no signs of obstructive disease in either structure. There is significant bronchiectasis noted in the peripheral regions of both lungs. Moderate emphysematous changes are appreciated bilaterally. Frequent linear atelectasis is identified throughout both lungs. Multiple nodules are noted, which, in the context of primary disease, suggest potential benign lesions rather than metastases. The largest nodule is located in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe, measuring approximately 10x15 mm at its broadest dimension (series 2 section 134). Lopeny lesions or infiltrative masses in both lungs remain indeterminate. Mediastinal structures are evaluated adequately despite the lack of contrast material. Overall, the heart shows signs of enlargement. Mild pleural effusion is indicated, along with moderate pericardial effusion. Furthermore, atheromatous changes are evident in the aorta and coronary circulation. The measurements of mediastinal vascular structures are irregular. Importantly, a port chamber is characterized in the left hemithorax, where the port catheter is seen terminating at the inferior distal portion of the vena cava. Enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilum have a pathological size. Significant thickening within the esophageal wall was not observed, and free fluid accumulation in the upper abdominal region is also absent. Retroperitoneal adipose tissue shows a mass with discernible borders. No fractures or destructive bone lesions can be identified in the identified specimens.
