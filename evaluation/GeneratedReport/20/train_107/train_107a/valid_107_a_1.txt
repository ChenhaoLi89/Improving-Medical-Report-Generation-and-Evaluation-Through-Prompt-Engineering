The mediastinum was optimally evaluated in this non-contrast examination. The trachea is displaced laterally, and significant obstructive pathology was observed in the lumen. The right lower-middle lobe bronchus appears patent with no mass involvement. The left upper lobe bronchus is widely patent. Normal conditions were found regarding the main vascular structures and the size of the heart. There were no indications of atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries. A large, circumscribed effusion was detected in the pericardial space, and pericardial thickening was noted. The thoracic esophagus exhibited significant wall thickening, contrary to normal calibration. There was only one lymph node noted in the right upper paratracheal region. It measured 5 mm in diameter, considerably smaller than prior findings. An acute hemorrhage was not detected in the right pleural space; the thickness recorded was just 5 mm. There were no signs of effusion in the left pleural space. In the lung parenchyma window, minimal network involvement was evident, and normal interlobular septal structures were seen, consistently throughout the lungs. When evaluating upper abdominal organs, the liver was noted to have normal studies, with smooth borders and no abnormal lesions. Both adrenal glands were normal size. The kidneys displayed numerous calculus formations. The spleen and pancreas appeared abnormal, with cystic formations visible. No metastatic lesions were observed within the bony structures in the study area.
