The examination noted no significative occlusion in the trachea or the main bronchi's lumens. However, the non-contrast study revealed complications in evaluating the mediastinum effectively. The mediastinal vascular structures, as well as the heart's dimensions, appeared enlarged, indicating potential abnormalities. A pericardial effusion or thickening was indeed noted. Minor calcific atherama plaques were detected in the aortic branches. The thoracic esophagus presented with a significant pathological wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes were observed in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, all measuring beyond normal limits. Slight emphysematous and fibrotic changes appeared in the lung parenchyma. Notable fresh fracture lines were highlighted in the 6th, 7th, and 10th ribs on the left, with specific reticular density changes noted within the lung tissues. In this study, scattered unstable millimetric nodules were not found in the parenchyma. The liver showed no signs of hypertrophy, while the spleen seemed underdeveloped. The kidneys exhibited multiple neoplastic growths. Additionally, fused spur formations were found at various points across the vertebral columnsâ€™ frontier in the documented examination area. These findings contributed to an overall understanding of the state of organ systems evaluated.
