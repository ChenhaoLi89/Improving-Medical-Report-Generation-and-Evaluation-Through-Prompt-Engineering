The trachea and the lumens of both main bronchi are clear and patent, with no significant occlusions identified. Mediastinal structures were assessed, though the evaluation was not optimal since it was performed without contrast enhancement. The caliber of major vascular structures in the mediastinum appears abnormal. The cardiac silhouette is unusually enlarged. Pericardial effusion and thickening are present. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is abnormal and significant wall thickening is evident. Lymphadenopathies were not found in the mediastinal, upper paratracheal, lower paratracheal, subcarinal, or right hilar regions. In the lung parenchyma assessment, there were no signs of bilateral peribronchial thickening detected. Nodular consolidations are present across various locations in both lung fields, with the largest noted in the lower lobe region, well-defined from the paramediastinal area. Increased ground-glass opacity is absent around the described consolidation zones. Fungal infections should be ruled out regardless. Clinical correlation and follow-up imaging are essential. Numerous large calculi are exclusive to the gallbladder, completely dominant upon examination. No abnormalities were seen in the tonsils. Multiple hypodense lesions identifiable in the spleen were characterized adequately in this scan. The presence of well-defined lytic destructive lesions in bone structures was confirmed, indicating metastatic activity.
