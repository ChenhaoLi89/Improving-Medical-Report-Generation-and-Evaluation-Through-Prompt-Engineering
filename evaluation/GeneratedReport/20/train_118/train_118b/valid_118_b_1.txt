The evaluation of mediastinal structures was adequate as the examination included contrast enhancement. Severe occlusive pathology was detected in both the trachea and the main bronchi, indicating significant complications. A catheter was noted extending inferiorly from the aorta. Calibration of the thoracic main vascular structures revealed significant dilation. The thoracic aorta showed marked dilatation greater than expected norms. The heart contour appeared notably enlarged, and pericardial effusion was present. While the thoracic esophagus was evaluated, evidence of major pathological wall thickening was recorded. Stable and locally conglomerated lymphadenopathies were identified in the mediastinal upper and lower paratracheal regions, with the massive conglomerated node exhibiting a short axis of 25 mm. In the lung parenchyma window, significant bilateral peribronchial thickenings were absent, with indications of considerable regression in previously observed nodular consolidations. Additionally, there seems to be minimal to no presence of pleural effusions bilaterally, measuring 10 mm on the right and 5 mm on the left. Moreover, effusion in the pericardial area has reached 3 mm in its thickest segment. Examination of the upper abdominal sections showed no hypodense lesions in liver segments 8 and 7, suggesting the absence of any abnormalities. Significant alterations were noted in other findings compared to previous examinations. Overall, this assessment reflects contrasting findings that warrant further investigation.
