A catheter image extending from the left internal jugular vein to the left atrium was observed. Significant occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and lumen of both main bronchi. The mediastinum could be evaluated optimally in this non-contrast examination. As noted, mediastinal main vascular structures and heart contour size are abnormal. A significant effusion was observed in the pleural space. Thoracic esophagus calibration was abnormal, and notable tumoral wall thickening was detected. Enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were identified. When evaluated in the lung parenchyma window, peribronchial thickenings, centriacinar nodules, and ground-glass opacities were observed in a single lung in the patient, who was not under follow-up for areas of consolidation. Additionally, there was no evidence of nodular consolidation-atelectasis in the left lung lower lobe laterobasal segment. Progressive hypodense lesions measuring 30 mm in diameter were found in liver segments 5 and 6 on upper abdominal CT scans. No calculus was observed in the gallbladder. Significant differences were found in various findings in the current examination compared to past evaluations.
