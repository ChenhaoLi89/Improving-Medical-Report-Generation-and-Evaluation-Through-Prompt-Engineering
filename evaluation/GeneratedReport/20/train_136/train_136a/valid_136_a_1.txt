The trachea and both main bronchi were clearly displaced from the midline, and obstructive pathology was present in the lumen. The non-contrast examination allowed for optimal evaluation of the mediastinum. Mediastinal vascular structures and the heart showed prominent abnormalities concerning both contour and dimensions. A significant pericardial effusion-thickening was noted. The thoracic esophagus displayed inconsistent calibration, suggesting notable tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were detected in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window, reticular nodular patterns of fibrotic density increases were predominantly noted in both lung bases. Active infiltration and mass lesions with distinct borders were identified in the left lung. The upper abdominal organs were severely unremarkable, showing multiple space-occupying lesions; particular alterations in the cross-sectional area of the liver were detected. The bilateral adrenal glands demonstrated irregularities with concerning space-occupying anomalies. Bone structures in the examined area were completely abnormal and exhibited fractures in vertebral corpus heights that were compromised. The reportâ€™s comprehensiveness suggests a need for further investigation into various thoracic and abdominal findings indicating potential pathologies that may require intervention or monitoring. Overall, the study revealed critical and concerning health insights.
