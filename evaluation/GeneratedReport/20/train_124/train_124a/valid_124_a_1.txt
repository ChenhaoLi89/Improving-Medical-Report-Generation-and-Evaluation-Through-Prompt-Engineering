The trachea and both main bronchi are narrowed, and occlusive pathology was identified in the trachea and both main bronchi. Ventilation of both lungs is abnormal, and multiple masses or infiltrative lesions were detected in both lungs. Mediastinal structures were evaluated optimally due to contrast material administration. Observations reveal that the heart contour and size are enlarged. Additionally, pleural and pericardial effusion was detected. The widths of the mediastinal main vascular structures are enlarged. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present in both the mediastinum and hilar regions. There is pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus observed in the sections. A hidden, significant type of hiatal hernia was noted at the upper end of the esophagus. Extensive free fluid collection was present in the upper abdomen as seen in the sections. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were observed. As far as can be reported from this examination, multiple discernible masses with indistinguishable margins were detected in the upper abdominal organs. Fractures and lytic-destructive lesions were identified in the bone structures as seen in the sections. Overall, the results need further evaluation in follow-up investigations.
