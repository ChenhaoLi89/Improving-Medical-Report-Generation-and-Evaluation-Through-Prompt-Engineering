CTO decreased in favor of the heart. The mediastinum is notable for extensive vascular abnormalities, which are not typical. The thoracic aorta exhibits an enlarged diameter. There is significant pericardial effusion observed, indicating potential distress. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is abnormal, and significant tumoral wall thickening is present. Additionally, a hiatal hernia is evident. Lymph nodes with pathological size and irregular configuration were detected in the mediastinal and hilar regions. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window, the hemithoraces are asymmetric. The calibration of the trachea and main bronchi is compromised, and the lumens show evidence of obstruction. Common consolidative parenchymal areas and ground glass densities are absent in both lungs, suggesting health. However, bilateral pleural effusion and a pneumothorax are present, which complicates the clinical picture. The surrounding soft tissue planes appear distorted. Notably, extensive degenerative changes are observed in the bone structure. In conclusion, while certain features remain normal, significant abnormalities in vascular structures, pleural spaces, and soft tissue integrity indicate the need for further investigation and management.
