The trachea and main bronchi appear patent, and meaningful obstructive pathology is noted. There is a significant increase in wall thickness within the thoracic esophagus, indicating possible esophagitis. However, a small sliding-type hiatal hernia is identified at the diaphragm. The evaluation of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac morphology was comprehensive due to adequate IV contrast utilization. Calcified atheroma plaques are distinctly absent in the thoracic aortic wall. The ascending aorta presents normal dimensions, measuring 30 mm in diameter, and the overall heart contour and size exhibit notable enlargement. Pericardial and pleural effusions, as well as pleural thickening, were observed. The mediastinum reveals multiple lymph nodes that appear pathological in both axillary regions, suggesting potential malignancy. In examining the lung parenchyma, both lungs demonstrate active infiltration and a mass lesion located in the right lower lobe. Notable emphysematous changes exist in the lower lobes of both lungs. There are no bronchiectatic changes noted. A mild diffuse increase in thickness surrounding the bronchial structures indicates possible COPD. A few small specific nodules were identified in the outer regions of both lungs. Within the computed tomography assessment, no abnormalities were attributable to the adrenal glands. Furthermore, no suspicious birefringent stones were located in either kidney. There was a significant amount of intra-abdominal free fluid observed, along with abnormal lymph nodes suggesting pathological enlargement. Bone evaluations revealed various destructive lesions affecting bone structure.
