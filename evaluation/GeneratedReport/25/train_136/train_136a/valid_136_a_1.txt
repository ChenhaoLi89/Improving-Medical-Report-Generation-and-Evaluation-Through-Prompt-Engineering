The trachea and both main bronchi were displaced, and obstructive pathology was noted in the lumen. During the non-contrast examination, the mediastinum was assessed adequately. The mediastinal vascular structures appeared abnormal, and heart size was found to be enlarged. Notably, pericardial effusion and thickening were present. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated abnormal calibration, and significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Upon examining the lung parenchyma window, no reticulonodular sequelae or fibrotic density increases were observed in both lung apexes. A mass lesion with active infiltration that had indistinguishable borders was present in both lungs. The upper abdominal organs, featured in the examination, were abnormal, revealing a prominent space-occupying lesion in the liver within the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands exhibited irregularities, and a notable space-occupying lesion was detected. The bone structures evaluated in the study area showed abnormalities. Vertebral corpus heights were considered compromised. Overall, this report indicates various abnormalities that warrant further investigation to assess the underlying conditions adequately.
