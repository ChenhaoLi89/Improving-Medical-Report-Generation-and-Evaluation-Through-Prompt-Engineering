The CT examination reveals slight abnormalities in several structures. The trachea and both main bronchi exhibit signs of obstruction, indicating potential respiratory issues. The assessment of the heart and major vascular structures demonstrates significant deviations from normal, with heart contour and size appearing enlarged. Furthermore, the thoracic aorta diameter is notably diminished. A substantial pericardial effusion was observed, causing thickening in surrounding tissues. Close inspection of the thoracic esophagus indicates severe tumoral wall thickening that raises concerns. Enlarged lymph nodes were detected in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, suggesting possible pathology in these areas. When analyzing the pulmonary parenchyma, both lung fields show poor aeration, and nodular or infiltrative lesions are unfortunately present in the lung tissue. Additionally, significant pleural thickening and effusion were noted. Regarding upper abdominal structures, no significant findings were documented with respect to the spleen, which was completely normal in appearance. However, a notable lesion is detected in the left kidney that appears to be a complex mass rather than a benign cyst. Finally, the bone structures within the examined area display significantly advanced degenerative changes contrary to what was expected.
