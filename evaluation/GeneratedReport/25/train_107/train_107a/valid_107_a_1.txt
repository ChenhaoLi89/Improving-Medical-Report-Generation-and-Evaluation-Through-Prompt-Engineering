The evaluation of the mediastinum in the non-contrast examination was determined to be optimal. The trachea is observed in the midline, and there is a notable obstructive pathology visible in the lumen of both main bronchi. The right lower-middle lobe bronchus is patent, without evidence of mass or obstruction. The left upper lobe bronchus appears normal. The mediastinal main vascular structures and heart size and contour exhibit signs of severe enlargement and significant pathology. Atherosclerotic wall calcifications are absent from the coronary arteries. A significant amount of fluid is present within the pericardial space, alongside observable thickening of the pericardial membrane. The thoracic esophagus shows marked wall thickening. Numerous diminutive lymph nodes are detected in the right upper paratracheal, left lower paratracheal, aortopulmonary, subcranial, and paraaortic regions, with the largest measuring 5 mm in diameter. Notable fluid is detected within both pleural spaces, with a notably thicker accumulation on the left reaching 22 mm. Lung imaging reveals areas of consolidation, but no nodules are observed. Meanwhile, evaluation of the upper abdominal organs indicates that the liver has multiple hypodense lesions with a large one measuring 10 mm, suggestive not of metastasis, but rather benign nodules. The adrenal glands are normal in size and morphology. Both kidneys contain several stones. The spleen exhibits no abnormalities, whilst no metastatic changes were identified in the bone structures within the study.
