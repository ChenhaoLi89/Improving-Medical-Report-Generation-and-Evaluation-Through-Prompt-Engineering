The CTO appears to be abnormal. The calibration of the ascending aorta is measured at 39 mm, which falls within a normal range. The descending aorta shows no significant prominence. Measurements of the aortic arch are noted at 28 mm, considered narrower than usual. Calibration of other major vascular structures within the mediastinum is abnormal. No catheter-like appearance is evident in the superior vena cava. Calcific atheroma plaques are absent from the aortic arch, but they are found in the ascending aorta and the coronary arteries. Several instances of lymph nodes with pathological size and configuration are detected within the mediastinum and hilar regions bilaterally. The thoracic esophagus displays thickening of the wall without any substantial tumoral transformation. Evaluation of lung parenchyma demonstrates that the trachea and main bronchi show abnormal calibration, with significant thickening noted around the peribronchovascular sheath. There are predominant emphysematous changes observed in the middle lobes, while linear densities suggest significant tumoral mass in various lung segments. A stable 7 mm diameter nodule exists in the upper lobe of the right lung, along with a new unstable nodule noted in the lower left lobe. There is evidence of new findings related to kidney contours without lobulation. The gallbladder is found to be small and normal, requiring no further intervention. The fractures of the lower left ribs appear less significant, with no signs of old injuries on review.
