The trachea and both main bronchi appear narrowed with partial obstruction noted in the right bronchus. The heart contour is abnormal, showing signs of enlargement, and the mediastinal main vascular structures are also distorted. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is measured to be slightly dilated. There is evidence of pericardial effusion and thickening around the pericardial area. The thoracic esophagus exhibits significant wall thickening concerning for tumor involvement. Enlarged lymph nodes were observed in prevascular and subcarinal locations, raising concern for possible malignancy. Evaluation of lung parenchyma revealed bilateral nodular lesions and infiltrative changes, necessitating further investigation. Additionally, moderate to severe pleural effusion was reported in both pleural cavities. The examination of upper abdominal organs indicated abnormalities, with a mass seen in the liver's cross-sectional area suggestive of a space-occupying lesion. The liver parenchyma shows early signs of cirrhosis rather than steatosis and may require close monitoring. The bilateral adrenal glands are enlarged, indicating possible hyperfunction. The bone structures assessed in the study area are invariably altered with signs of osteoporosis prevalence. Finally, vertebral corpus heights appear normal and preserved.
