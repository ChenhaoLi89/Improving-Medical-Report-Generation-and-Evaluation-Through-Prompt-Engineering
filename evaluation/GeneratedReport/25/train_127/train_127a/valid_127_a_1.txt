The evaluation of the trachea and both main bronchi did not reveal any obstructive pathology present. The mediastinum was adequately assessed during the non-contrast examination. The mediastinal vascular structures appear abnormal, and the heart size is too large. Notably, pericardial effusion and thickening were reported. There were no atherosclerotic wall calcifications in the aortic arch or coronary arteries, and the aortic valve appears normal. Abnormal wall thickness of the distal esophagus was characterized by an irregular surface in a 5.9 cm segment. Paralleling this, significant paraesophageal lymph node enlargement was noted, with the largest measuring 11x7 mm, suggesting possible pathology requiring further assessment. No therapeutically significant enlarged lymph nodes were visible in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Within the lung parenchyma, no emphysematous changes were observed, but predominantly normal mosaic attenuation was present in lower lobes. Segmental bronchial walls were thickened, and small airway stasis-related issues were noted bilaterally. Furthermore, there were no findings of calcareous nodules in either lung. Interestingly, changes consistent with recent pulmonary conditions were evident in lower lung segments. Conversely, no abdominal abnormalities were detected, nor did liver lesions lead to cross-sectional visualization. Notably, adrenal glands were disproportionately enlarged, and a stone over 2 cm in size was found within the gallbladder lumen. The bone structures within the study maintained irregular characteristics, and vertebral stability was compromised.
