The trachea and both main bronchi are noted to be partially occluded, though some clear spaces were identified. Pathological conditions were present in the trachea, and significant narrowing was detected in the right main bronchus. Ventilation of the right lung shows abnormalities, and an infiltrative lesion was observed in the left lung. Mediastinal structures have been inadequately assessed since adequate contrast material was not administrated. The heart contour appears enlarged and abnormal in size. Pleural effusion is noted, with moderate fluid accumulation present around the lungs. The dimensions of the mediastinal main vascular structures show significant abnormality. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are observable in both the mediastinum and hilar regions, indicating potential oncological concerns. An increase in the esophageal wall thickness is noted, suggestive of pathological changes within the esophagus; however, there is no evidence of a hiatal hernia. Free fluid collections are significant and located in the upper abdomen, with large lymph nodes causing concern for malignancy. Additionally, distinct masses with recognizable margins were discerned throughout the upper abdominal organs. No signs of fractures or lytic-destructive lesions within the bone structures were documented in this examination, indicative of stability in the skeletal system as per the available imaging.
