The trachea and both main bronchi are patent, with no obstructive pathology noted. Mediastinal structures were assessed and appeared optimal due to the thorough evaluation. The sizing of thoracic major vascular structures is abnormal. The heart appears significantly enlarged; however, pericardial thickening and effusion were noted. There is no prosthetic material seen in the aortic valve, and no suture material could be identified on the wall of the ascending aorta. The thoracic esophagus is mildly constricted, and appreciable pathological wall thickening was found. Lymph nodes were not observed in any paratracheal or subcarinal areas. In the evaluation of both lung parenchyma windows, areas of consolidation were not visible, and no ground-glass opacities were identifiable, ruling out any infectious process entirely. Clinical correlation is unnecessary as the interseptal lines appeared normal throughout both lungs, with no alterations noted in the lower lobes. There is no evidence of free fluid in the pleural spaces on either side. Both fissures are observed as thin. No significant mass lesions or asymmetry were detected in the non-enhanced examination of the lung parenchyma. Minimal emphysematous changes have been ruled out in both lungs. The upper abdominal sections that were examined appear irregular. The calibration of the bilateral adrenal glands shows abnormal findings associated with space-occupying lesions. No metal suture materials related to sternotomy are seen within the chest cavity. All bone structures show clear lytic activity.
