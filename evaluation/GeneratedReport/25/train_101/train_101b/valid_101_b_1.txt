The trachea and both primary bronchi were found displaced to the left, and obstructive pathology was identified within the lumen. The mediastinum was evaluated optimally during the non-contrast examination. Vascular structures within the mediastinum appeared unnaturally enlarged. Aconfirmed lack of atherosclerotic changes was noted in the thoracic-abdominal aorta and coronary arteries. The heart size was within normal limits, and both the mitral valve and aortic valve were found to be free of calcifications. A slight pericardial effusion was detected, and there was significant thickening around the heart. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated abnormal calibration with noted considerable tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. In the lung parenchyma window, no peripheral peribronchial thickening was visible in the lungs. Emphysematous changes were noted exclusively in the left lung. Bulla formations were absent at the apices. The right hemidiaphragm was lowered. Increases in pleuroparenchymal density were seen predominantly in the right lung's upper lobe and oblique lingular segment. Active infiltration characterized by a mass lesion was identified in both lungs. Lesions that proved to be cysts in the imaging were indeterminate. A small millimetric simple cortical cyst was noted in the lower pole of the right kidney. The bilateral adrenal glands were larger than normal, which may indicate space-occupying lesions. Osteoporosis seen within the bone structures. The vertebral corpus heights were diminished.
