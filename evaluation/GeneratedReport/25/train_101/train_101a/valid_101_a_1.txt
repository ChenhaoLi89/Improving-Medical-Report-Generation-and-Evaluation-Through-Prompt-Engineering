The examination was performed without contrast and the evaluation of the mediastinal structures appeared optimal. Both the trachea and lumen of the main bronchi were noted to be obstructed, with evidence of significant occlusive pathology present. The major vascular structures in the mediastinum showed abnormalities. No calcific atherosclerotic changes were identified in the walls of the thoracic abdominal artery and coronary artery, suggesting a healthy vascular state. The heart size appeared normal, showing no signs of cardiomegaly. Pleural thickening and effusion were detected upon examination. Esophageal calibration was irregular at the assessed sections, and significant pathological wall thickening was observed. Lymph nodes with abnormal size and characteristics were noted in the mediastinal and bilateral hilar areas. Upon examining the lung parenchyma window, marked thickening was present in healthy558 the center of both lungs. Emphysematous changes were absent in both lungs. Compared to the previous examination, an increase in size and number of specific parenchymal nodules was observed in both lungs, with the largest now measuring 10 mm in diameter in the lower lobe. Mass infiltration was detected in both lung parenchyma. Pleuroparenchymal sequelae were minimal. It contained bulla formations in the lower regions of both lungs, considered a cause for concern. Further, upper abdominal sections trended towards significant deviations in appearance. A sizeable complex cyst was noted in the upper pole of the left kidney. Uncontrolled adrenal gland enlargement was identified along with multiple space-occupying lesions and destructive changes present in bone structures.
