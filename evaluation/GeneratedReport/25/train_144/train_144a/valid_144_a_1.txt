The trachea and main bronchi appear narrowed with potential obstructive lesions noted in the trachea itself. The diameter of the ascending aorta was measured at 40 mm, with no evidence of dilatation observed. The pulmonary artery diameter was reported at 30 mm and showed signs of constriction rather than dilation. The overall heart size is reduced. No calcified changes were noted in the coronary arteries or thoracic aorta. A large mass was identified within the lower lobe of the left lung, originating from the left upper paratracheal region and extending to the upper lobe, compressing the peripheral left main bronchus, with an approximate length of 10 cm. It is likely a benign lesion and not lymphadenopathy. The examination notes normal ventilatory function distally to the mass without any atelectasis. Additionally, benign lymph nodes sized at 15x12 mm were found in the left hila jamii with incidence defined indicating healthy functioning lymphatic tissues. In the assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma, interstitial changes noted in parts of the right lung are consistent with inflammation. Various nodular densities were noted distributed throughout both lungs. A mild pleural effusion measuring no more than 15 mm was seen on the left side, while minimal effusion was detected on the right. Evident lung structure appeared normal, without emerging emphysematous changes. Within the hepatic region, hyperdense lesions averaging near 21 mm in diameter were bilateral, considered hemorrhoidal? Additionally, significant cysts measuring less than 50 mm remain absent in and around both renal structures with no detectable degeneration.
