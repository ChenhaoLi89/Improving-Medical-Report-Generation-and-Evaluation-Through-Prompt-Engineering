The trachea and both main bronchi are observed to be constricted, with significant obstructive pathology present. The evaluation of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac examination was optimal due to sililar contrast enhancement. Calibration anomalies were noted in the mediastinal vascular structures, where heart contours and sizes appeared atypical. There is clear pericardial effusion present, correlating with thickening observed. Thoracic esophagus measurement displayed abnormalities with marked pathological wall thickening detected. In mediastinal lymph node stations, abnormal lymph nodes were identified, including one that measures 25 mm in diameter at the precarinal level. The lung parenchyma window shows clear lucent areas in the bilateral lower lobe anterior segments of the lungs and the superior segment of the left lung demonstrating normal bronchial architecture without chung consolidation patterns. Such findings are primarily deemed without relevance to infectious pathologies, thus no further imaging recommendation is necessary after treatment. Additionally, significant emphysematous changes are absent in both lungs. No abnormal nodular lesions were detected in fluid density with counterpart ramifying in unilateral kidneys. AÈùû fusiform aneurysm is noted in the abdominal aorta without a hyperdense endovenous appearance. Multiple extensive lytic lesions were observed in the bone structures within the imaging, while vertebral corpus heights are significantly diminished. Osteophytic degenerative changes appear fragmented with no demonstration of merging in vertebral corpus end plates.
