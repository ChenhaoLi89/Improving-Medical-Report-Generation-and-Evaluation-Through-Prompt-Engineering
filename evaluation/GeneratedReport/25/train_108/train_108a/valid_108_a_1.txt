The trachea and both main bronchi show signs of significant obstruction, with multiple areas of occlusive pathology identified. A pronounced pathological increase in wall thickness is noted in the thoracic esophagus. Due to excellent contrast application, the evaluation of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac examination was optimal, showing stability in the size and contour of the heart. Notably, a considerable amount of pericardial effusion exists. Both aorta and coronary vascular structures display clear signs of extensive aneurysms. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes have been identified in both axillary regions and at the supraclavicular level, posing potential clinical concerns. Upon examining the lung parenchyma window, active infiltration or a significant mass lesion is noted within both lungs. Moderate bronchiectasis specifically localized within the lower lobes is observed along with complete emphysematous changes throughout the lung fields. There are remarkable increases in lung density concerning structural preservation, resulting in volume expansion observed centrally in both lung apexes. Height loss is noted in the lower end plateau of the T3 vertebra, whereas bone structures exhibit entirely abnormal contours. The anteroposterior diameter of the vertebral body is a source of critical concern due to abnormal measurements. The evaluative appearance indicates a pronounced case of malignant fragmentation and instability in evidence.
