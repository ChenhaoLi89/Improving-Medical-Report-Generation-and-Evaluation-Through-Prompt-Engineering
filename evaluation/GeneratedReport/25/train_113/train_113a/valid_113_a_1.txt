The CTO is abnormal and outside the normal range. Calibration of the mediastinal vascular structures appears irregular. Thymic tissue is absent from the anterior mediastinum, eliminating any trigonal configuration presence, and instead, there are no signs of fat involution observed. Enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum are noted in pathological size and configuration. Pathological size and configuration lymph nodes, however, were found at both hilar levels. Both hemithorax are asymmetric. The trachea shows a significant narrowing, and the lumens of the main bronchi are compromised. The thoracic esophagus demonstrates thickening of the wall with significant tumoral changes noted. There are swollen lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal regions, and bilateral hilar axes show significant pathology. On examination within the lung parenchyma window; a 2 mm diameter specific nodule is prominently noted on the interlobar fissure course in the left lung, along with another nodule with a diameter of 5 mm at this level. Increased findings consistent with mild pneumonia are present. 

Evaluating the upper abdominal organs included in the imaging, densities compatible with significant calculi greater than 5 mm in diameter are observed in the middle portion of the left kidney. The bilateral adrenal glands show one abnormality consistent with a space-occupying lesion. Severe degenerative changes within the bone structures in the examination area are noted.
