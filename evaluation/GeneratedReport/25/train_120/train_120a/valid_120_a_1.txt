During the examination, bilateral gynecomastia was noted. The trachea and both main bronchi were found to be deviated, with significant obstructive pathology identified within the lumen. The mediastinum could be optimally evaluated in the contrast examination. The mediastinal main vascular structures and heart contours appeared to be abnormal in size. Pericardial effusion was present and noted to be significant. No stent material was detected in the coronary arteries. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated severe calibration issues, and substantial pathological thickening of the walls was observed. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were noted in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and subcarinal regions, as well as both hilar-axillary regions. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma, extensive bronchiectasis and marked peribronchial thickening were seen in both lungs. The most concerning interlobular septal thickening and ground-glass opacities were not evident in either lungâ€™s subpleural areas or lower lobe segments. The initial evaluation did not support fibrotic sequelae from Covid-19 pneumonia. There were no pleural adhesions present in the left lung upper lobe or elsewhere. Parenchymal nodules with a diameter of 5.4 mm were observed bilaterally. A significant mass lesion with active borders was detected in the lungs. In summary, all upper abdominal organs demonstrated notable pathological features, including multiple space-occupying lesions in the liver. Considerable thickening was noted in both adrenal glands, accompanied by mild but significant osteodegenerative changes in various bone structures throughout the examined area.
