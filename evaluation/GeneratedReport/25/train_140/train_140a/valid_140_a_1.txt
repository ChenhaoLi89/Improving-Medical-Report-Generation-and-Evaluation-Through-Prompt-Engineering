The evaluation of the trachea and the lumen of both main bronchi showed significant occlusive pathology. During the non-contrast examination, the mediastinal structures were effectively assessed, revealing abnormalities in the main vascular structures and an irregular heart contour. Notably, there was substantial pericardial effusion detected. In contrast to prior examinations, calcific atheroma plaques were absent in the aortic arch, indicating improved cardiovascular health. The thoracic esophagus displayed significant wall thickening, which necessitates further investigation. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes exceeded pathological dimensions in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and subcarinal regions, suggesting lymphadenopathy. On examination of the lung parenchyma window, there were no noticeable emphysematous changes, and significant fibrotic changes were absent. There were no old fracture lines present, refuting previous reports of rib injuries. Nonspecific subpleural densities were absent, alongside ground glass opacity or reticular patterns in the adjacent parenchyma. New nonspecific nodules were absent in the lung parenchyma. Additionally, mild shrinking rather than hypertrophy was observed in the liver's left lobe. The spleen appeared shrunken, and both kidneys demonstrated no cysts. No spur formations bridge the vertebral body in the section area, instead indicating a uniform characteristic overall in the evaluated region.
