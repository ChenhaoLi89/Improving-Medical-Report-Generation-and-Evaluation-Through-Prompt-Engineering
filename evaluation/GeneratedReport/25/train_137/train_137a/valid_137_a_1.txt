The CT examination revealed that the cardiac silhouette is unchanged in comparison to prior studies. The mediastinal major vascular structures appeared abnormal, showing signs of dilation. The diameter of the thoracic aorta was notably increased, raising concern for potential pathology. There was a presence of significant pericardial effusion with visible thickening noted. Evaluation of the thoracic esophagus demonstrated abnormal calibration, and tumoral wall thickening of considerable extent was detected. Additionally, a hiatus hernia was prominent. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were observed at both mediastinal and hilar regions. Upon examining the lung parenchyma, the hemithoraces displayed asymmetry. The trachea and main bronchi displayed suggestive abnormalities with partial occlusion. Notable consolidative areas in the parenchymal tissue and dense ground-glass opacities were observed throughout both lungs. The examination did indicate bilateral pleural effusion and no signs of pneumothorax were identified. The surrounding soft tissue appeared distorted aside from unwarranted changes in the bony structures, displaying active degeneration. Ultimately, the findings reveal a significant deterioration of the thoracic cavity anatomy, necessitating further investigation and evaluation of potential underlying conditions for optimal patient management.
