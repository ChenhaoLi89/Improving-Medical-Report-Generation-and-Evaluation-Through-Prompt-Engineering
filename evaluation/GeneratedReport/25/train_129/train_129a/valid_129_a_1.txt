The trachea was observed to be displaced to the left of both main bronchi, and obstructive pathology was detected in the lumen. The mediastinum was evaluated excellently in the non-contrast examination. The main vascular structures of the mediastinum, along with the heartâ€™s contours and size, appeared abnormal. A significant pericardial effusion and thickening were identified. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus was abnormal, and marked pathological wall thickening was present. A restrictive type hiatal hernia was noted at the upper end of the esophagus. Enlarged lymph nodes were identified within prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and both hilar-axillary regions with pathological dimensions indicated. In the lung parenchyma window examination, several prominent parenchymal nodules larger than 5 mm in diameter were found in the right lung. Besides this, numerous mass lesions and active infiltration with indistinct borders were detected in both lungs. The upper abdominal organs included in the sections show several abnormalities. Space-occupying lesions were detected in the liver that covered the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands were assessed as abnormal, with space-occupying lesions visible. Severe scoliosis with left opening was seen at the thoracic level. Vertebral corpus heights are significantly diminished.
