The imaging shows the port chamber and the catheter descending toward the inferior vena cava, located on the posterior chest wall. The trachea and both main bronchi were slightly displaced, and mild obstructive pathology was noted in the lumen. In the non-contrast assessment, the mediastinal structures were adequately evaluated. The main mediastinal vascular structures and heart size appear irregular. Pericardial effusion-thickening was present. Evaluation of the thoracic esophagus revealed marked dilation, and significant pathological wall thickening was detected. Enlarged lymph nodes of abnormal dimensions were noted in the prevascular and bilateral hilar regions. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window, several millimetric specific parenchymal nodules were observed in the right lung; clear mass lesions with pneumonic infiltrations were detected in various areas of the left lung. Exploring the sections, the upper abdominal organs displayed abnormal findings. Multiple space-occupying lesions were identified in the liver that contributed to the abnormalities viewed in the cross-sectional area. Analysis indicated abnormal findings within the bilateral adrenal glands, showing multiple nodular formations. The bone structures in the evaluated area appeared deformed, with altered vertebral corpus heights. Solid organs in the intra-abdominal region were poorly evaluated during MR examination.
