The trachea and both main bronchi are noted to be partially obstructed. There's a significant pericardial effusion present, with marked thickening observed. The contour and size of the mediastinal cardiovascular structures and heart are abnormal, suggesting possible underlying issues. The thoracic esophagus exhibits irregular calibration, and significant pathological wall thickening is noted. Enlarged lymph nodes are clearly identifiable in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal as well as bilateral hilar-axillary regions, all of which are indicative of potential pathology. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma window, extensive fibrotic densities have been observed at the subpleural level predominantly in the upper segments of both lungs. The upper abdominal organs included in these sections show several abnormalities, and a space-occupying lesion was found within the liver. The bilateral adrenal glands displayed unusual enlargement, with corresponding space-occupying lesions detected in them as well. The bony structures within the assessed region demonstrate some irregularities, parental to active degenerative changes, with the vertebral body heights found to be mildly decreased. Overall, these findings accentuate potential pathological conditions that merit further evaluation and may require management interventions for comprehensive care.
