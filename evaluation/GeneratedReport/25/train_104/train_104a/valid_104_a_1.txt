The trachea and both main bronchi are significantly narrowed. The mediastinal vascular structures and heart appearance show abnormalities; the size is enlarged. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is dilated. Notably, pericardial effusion is present alongside significant thickening. There are no calcific plaques detected in the coronary arteries. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus reveals significant tumoral wall thickening, highlighting the presence of potential malignancy. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar axillary regions were found to be significantly enlarged. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma, no bronchiectasis was indicated, and infiltration was present in various areas of the lung parenchyma. Notably, pleural effusion and thickening were both observed within the thoracic cavity. Regarding the upper abdominal organs, assessment indicates a homogeneous density buildup in the liver. Larger-sized stones were identified in the gallbladder. Additionally, there is no evidence of osteophytes in the thoracic vertebrae, although moderate fibrotic patterns are noticeable in the adjacent lung parenchyma. This examination indicates varied pathologies and requires further evaluation to properly address the findings noted in multiple areas throughout the thoracic and upper abdominal regions.
