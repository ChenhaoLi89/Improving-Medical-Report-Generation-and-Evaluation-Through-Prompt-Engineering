The assessment of mediastinal structures revealed optimal conditions for examination due to enhanced imagery methods used. No significant pathology was identified in the trachea or the lumens of the main bronchi. An image depicting a catheter was noted as extending into the heart rather than superiorly to the vena cava. The calibration of the thoracic main vascular structures appeared abnormal. Dilatation was observed in the thoracic aorta, which was concerning. However, the heart contour was noted to be enlarged, and pericardial thickening with diffuse fluid accumulation was detected. The thoracic esophagus also displayed abnormal calibration, coupled with significant pathological wall thickening. Incidentally, previously observed stable local lymphadenopathies were no longer evident, with the size shrinking significantly from a prior measurement of 18 mm in diameter. The evaluation of lung parenchyma demonstrated bilateral normalizations without peribronchial thickening. Notably, there was a slight decrease in nodular consolidation areas within both lungs. Additionally, between bilateral pleural leaves, the presence of free pleural effusion was reported at 25 mm on the right and 15 mm on the left. Remarkably, no effusion was detected in the pericardial area this time. Upon reviewing the upper abdominal sections, there were no hypodense lesions identified in liver segments. Changes from the earlier observation indicated an increase in lesion diameter rather than stability. Generally, significant modifications to previous findings were absent during this examination.
