The trachea and both main bronchi are patent, and no obstructive disease was identified in these structures. However, the assessment of mediastinal components was deemed optimal, as the examination was conducted with contrast enhancement. The size of mediastinal major vascular structures is normal. The contour of the heart appears enlarged. There is significant pericardial effusion noted. The thoracic esophagus shows abnormal caliber, with noticeable pathological wall thickening. There are no signs of lymphadenopathy in the mediastinal region, upper or lower paratracheal, subcarinal areas, or the right paratracheal-hilar area. In the lung parenchyma window, unilateral peribronchial thickenings are seen. In the right lower lobe, nodular consolidations were observed but can be easily differentiated from surrounding lung tissue. No ground glass opacities are apparent surrounding these areas. Fungal infections are ruled out in the differential diagnosis request. No calculi were identified in the kidneys or gallbladder penetrated during the study. A few uniform lesions in various anatomical locations were seen in the spleen, which appear well defined upon evaluation. No hypodense lesions were present in liver segments 8 and 7. Additionally, some lytic-destructive lesions were detected in the bone structures, marking a profound deviatory finding within the examination. Further evaluation and clinical correlation are recommended for clarity on the imaging findings.
