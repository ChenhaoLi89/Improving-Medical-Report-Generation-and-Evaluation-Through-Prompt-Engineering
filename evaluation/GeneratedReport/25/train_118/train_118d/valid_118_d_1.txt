A catheter image was noted extending from the right internal jugular vein to the left atrium. No occlusive pathology was found in the trachea, and the left main bronchus only appeared slightly dilated. The mediastinum was adequately evaluated in the non-contrast examination. Upon review, the mediastinal main vascular structures revealed an abnormal contour, and the heart size was slightly enlarged. A large effusion was detected in the pericardial space. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated notable deformity, with significant tumoral wall thickening present. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions were observed, indicating potential pathology. In the lung parenchyma window; both lungs appeared clear with no signs of peribronchial thickening, centriacinar nodules, or ground glass areas. Additionally, there was good aeration in the right lung, with no evidence of nodular consolidation-atelectasis. Lesions within segments 7 and 8 of the liver showed an increase in size, measuring 25 mm in diameter upon subsequent examinations. Calculus was absent in the gallbladder during this imaging study. There was a considerable difference noted in other findings during the current assessment compared to prior reports. No other significant abnormalities were distinguished in the thoracic and abdominal regions of this examination.
