The trachea and both main bronchi are not completely open, indicating possible obstructive pathology in these airways. There are significant pleuroparenchymal sequelae changes observed in the lung apex areas. Noticeable emphysematous changes appear in one of the lungs, although both are primarily affected. Both lungs contain several nodules that are larger than 6 mm in diameter, with a significant mass located in the superior segment of the denial lobe of the left lung being the largest. An infiltrative lesion was detected in the left lung indicating possible malignancy. Mediastinal structures were evaluated optimally due to the adequate contrast material provided. Cardiac contour appears irregular, accompanied by moderate pleural or pericardial effusion. The widths of the main vascular structures in the mediastinum are atypical and show signs of an enlargement. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were discovered in both the mediastinum and hilar regions requiring further investigation. Pathological wall thickening of the esophagus was noted in the evaluated sections. There appears to be free fluid-collection in the upper abdominal area. Enlarged lymph nodes that demonstrate pathological dimensions have been detected. Regarding the upper abdominal organs, there is a mass present with indistinct borders in the sections analyzed. Thoracic vertebral corpus heights, alignments, and densities were abnormal, indicating potential issues. Intervertebral disc distances are compromised. The neural foramina are constricted, with multiple lytic-destructive lesions visible in the bone structures within the items examined.
