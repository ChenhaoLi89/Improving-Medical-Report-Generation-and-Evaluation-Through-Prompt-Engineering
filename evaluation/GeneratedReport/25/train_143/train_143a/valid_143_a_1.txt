The trachea was noted to be slightly deviated from the midline, and significant obstructive pathology was detected in the lumen of both main bronchi. The mediastinum was evaluated properly in the non-contrast examination, with abnormalities observed in the mediastinal main vascular structures; however, the heart contour and size appeared abnormal. Mild pericardial effusion and thickening were present. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated abnormal calibration with notable tumoral wall thickening evident. A type of hiatal hernia that is not specified was observed near the upper end of the esophagus. Enlarged lymph nodes of pathological dimensions were identified in the prevascular and zoned hilar regions. Upon examining the lung parenchyma, pleuroparenchymal fibroatelectasis was not detected, although at least one active mass lesion with indistinguishable borders was found in the left lung. The upper abdominal organs revealed abnormalities not typically associated with normal function in the sections viewed. A significant space-occupying lesion was seen in the liver that encroached on the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands showed evidence of enlargement, and space-occupying lesions were present. Significant degenerative changes in the bone structures in the examination area were noted, indicating extensive pathological alteration. Overall, these findings necessitate further evaluation and monitoring.
