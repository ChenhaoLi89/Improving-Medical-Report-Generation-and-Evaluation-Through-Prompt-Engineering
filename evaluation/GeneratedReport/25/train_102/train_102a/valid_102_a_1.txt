A mass measuring 3 cm is noted in the thinnest part of the left lung, failing to surround the pleura at its apex. Effusion areas between the pleural leaves on the left side measure 63 mm at their thickest point, with clear fluid and no loculation evident. In the lower lobe of the right lung, there is a reduction in reticular densities with smooth borders that were interpreted as consistent with normal lung structure. There is a consolidation area in the upper lobe with significant air bronchograms and clear expansions. The parietal pleura shows extensive smooth thickenings. Soft tissue densities are absent in the paratracheal region, with no notable necrotic changes or lymphadenopathy present. Additionally, there are no necrotic lymphadenopathies observed in the noted mediastinal areas, with the largest measuring only 1 cm on the short axis. Emphysema is minimal in the left lung, with no noted fibrosis or bulla formation and volume retention intact. Numerous millimetric parenchymal nodules are present in the lungs, including a prominent 10 mm nodule in the left upper lobe, not the right. The upper abdominal organs show no lymphadenopathy, and no significant structures are observed near the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. Bone structures in the analyzed region exhibit atypical formations with vertebral corpus heights reduced significantly.
