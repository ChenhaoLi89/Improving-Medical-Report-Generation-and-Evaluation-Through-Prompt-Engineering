The examination revealed that the trachea and both main bronchi were patent. The outlines of the heart, and the size and position of mediastinal vascular structures, appeared abnormal. Notably, a prominent pericardial effusion and thickening were present. The thoracic esophagus exhibited marked wall thickening, diverging from normal calibration. Enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions were significantly detected. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma, a 5 mm diameter pulmonary nodule in the left lung lower lobe laterobasal segment was confirmed, accompanied by a linear subsegmental atelectasis area adjacent to this nodule. Additionally, there were multiple nodules in both lungs, indicative of aggressive calcification. Evaluation of the upper abdominal structures also depicted abnormalities, including serious lesions affecting the liver. The bilateral adrenal glands were abnormal with evident lesions detected. Bone structures within the study area showed irregularities, and vertebral corpus heights were not preserved. Overall, findings suggest concerning pathological changes affecting various regions investigated, particularly in the cardiorespiratory system, abdomen, and skeletal structures necessitating further assessment and management.
