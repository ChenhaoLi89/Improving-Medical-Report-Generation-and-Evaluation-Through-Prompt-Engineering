The trachea and both main bronchi are partially obstructed. The mediastinal main vascular structures could be evaluated optimally due to the availability of contrast in the examination, revealing abnormal configurations of various vessels; however, the heart contour and size appeared compromised. The thoracic aorta diameter is enlarged. Evidence of pericardial effusion and significant thickening was detected. The evaluation of the thoracic esophagus indicated an abnormal calibration with notable tumoral wall thickening present. Several enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions showing pathological dimensions were identified. When assessing the lung parenchyma window, aeration of both lung parenchyma was severely compromised, with multiple nodular and infiltrative lesions observed within the lung tissues. Pleural effusion and thickening were prominently detected. Upper abdominal organs included in the assessment showed signs of significant abnormalities. Furthermore, several lytic or destructive lesions were identified within the bone structures in the study area, raising concerns for metastatic disease. Overall, the evaluation provided a mixed result with critical findings that warrant further investigation to provide clarity regarding the underlying conditions weighted against expectations drawn from average cases. Further diagnostic imaging will be necessary based on these abnormal findings.
