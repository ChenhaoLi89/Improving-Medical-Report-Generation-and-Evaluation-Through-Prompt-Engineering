The trachea and both main bronchi are narrowed. The mediastinal main vascular structures and the heart shape show abnormalities, with changes in size noted. The thoracic aorta presents an abnormal diameter. There is significant pericardial effusion-thickening observed. The thoracic esophagus shows irregular calibration and notable tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions are seen in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Upon examining the lung parenchyma, there are multiple sizeable nodules scattered throughout both lungs. Ground-glass densities are prominently observed in the right lung lower lobe anterior and the left lung lower lobe medial, appearing markedly distinct from the surrounding parenchyma. A pathological assessment indicates an immediate need for clinical correlation and a close follow-up due to a probable infectious concern. Nodular lesions are evident in both lung parenchymas. Additionally, pleural effusion-thickening was identified. The upper abdominal organs assessment reveals changes consistent with hepatomegaly within the liver parenchyma. The bilateral adrenal glands show abnormalities with a concerning mass detected. An 11 mm hypodense finding in the upper zone of the right kidney raises suspicion for malignancy. Bone structures in the study show signs of degeneration, while vertebral corpus heights are considerably decreased.
