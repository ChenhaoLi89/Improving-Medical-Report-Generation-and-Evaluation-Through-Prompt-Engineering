The trachea and both main bronchi are partially obstructed. The mediastinum's main vascular structures are altered. Heart size is normal for this patient. The thoracic aorta presents with a notable enlargement. No pericardial effusion or thickening has been observed. The thoracic esophagus displays abnormal calibration with significant tumoral wall thickening suggestive of malignancy. There is an absence of lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and those present are notably larger, some having calcifications whose short axes exceed 8 mm. Upon examination using the lung parenchyma window, multiple lesions measuring up to 30x25 mm have been detected in the upper lobe of the expectant motherâ€™s left lung, with the largest displaying smooth contours and no evidence of cavitation evident in either lung. A decrease in size of the liver and spleen is documented, contrary to the earlier report. The bone structures in the assessed area are abnormal and show severe degeneration. Vertebral corpus heights are significantly compressed. Overall, the report suggests various abnormalities and contrasts the usual anatomical criteria that warrant further follow-up assessments and possible intervention for the identified lesions.
