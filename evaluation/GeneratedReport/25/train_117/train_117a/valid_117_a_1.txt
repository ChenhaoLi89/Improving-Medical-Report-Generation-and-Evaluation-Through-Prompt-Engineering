The trachea and both main bronchi appear abnormal, displaying obstructive pathology in these structures. Significant bronchiectasis is noted throughout the peripheral regions of both lungs. There are extensive emphysematous changes observed in specific areas of both lungs. Linear atelectasis is prevalent only in the right lung and there are no nodules detected. Any nodules previously evaluated suggest benign lesions; thus, metastatic disease is unlikely. The largest of the absent nodules, estimated at approximately 12x15 mm, was formerly identified in the imaginations of the left lung upper lobe. Clear mass or infiltrative lesions are, in fact, visible in both lungs. Mediastinal structures were optimally evaluated; apparent abnormalities include an abnormal size and shape of the heart. Considerable pleural and pericardial effusion is absent. The coronary arteries show no signs of atheroma plaques. The widths of the mediastinal vascular structures are those of malformations. A port chamber nowhere is identified in either hemithorax, and there is a potential pathological infiltration around the vena cava. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are robustly present in the mediastinum and hilar regions. Substantial wall thickness increases were observed within the esophagus in the analyzed sections. A significant collection of free fluid was detected in the upper abdomen. Enlarged lymph nodes have been confirmed, along with various masses with clearly distinguishable borders appearing in the peritoneum and omentum. Bone structures remain unaffected, displaying no fractures or destructive lesions throughout the analysis.
