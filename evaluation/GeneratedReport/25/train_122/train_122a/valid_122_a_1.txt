The trachea, along with both main bronchi, shows significant constriction. The mediastinal main vascular structures, as well as the heart's contour and size, appear abnormal. Notably, pericardial effusion has occurred, and thickening has been observed. The thoracic esophagus is notably dilated, and there is significant pathological wall thickening identified. Enlarged lymph nodes with prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary dimensions have suggested considerable concern. The lung parenchyma was analyzed, revealing inadequate aeration of both lung parenchymas with multiple nodular and infiltrative lesions identified. Furthermore, pleural effusion with thickening was noted. In the upper abdominal organs captured by this imaging session, abnormal findings are present. A large space-occupying lesion has been identified in the liver impacting the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands appeared to be abnormal and evidence of a space-occupying lesion can be seen. The bone structures within the study area are noticeably abnormal, exhibiting fractures and deformities. The vertebral corpus heights have shown deterioration instead of being preserved, reflecting significant alteration in the overall bone quality.
