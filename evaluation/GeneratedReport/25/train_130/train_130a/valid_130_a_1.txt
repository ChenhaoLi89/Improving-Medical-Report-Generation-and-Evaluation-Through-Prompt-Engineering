The CTO measurements fall outside the normal range. The aortic arch shows signs of abnormal calibration. Other mediastinal vascular structures demonstrate unusual characteristics. Notable atheromatous plaques are visible in the aortic arch as well as in the left subclavian artery. Coronary arteries are free of calcific atheromatous plaques. A nasogastric tube is present, and in the patient with a history of laryngeal cancer, a mass lesion significantly narrows the laryngeal lumen without impacting surrounding soft tissues. The patient lacks a tracheostomyurn. Subcutaneous air or fluid is not visible between the neck and thorax. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum, which appears symmetrical and uniform. Notably, subcutaneous emphysema is absent at the supraclavicular region. Pathological-sized lymph nodes have been identified in the mediastinum and at both hilar levels. Symmetry of the hemithorax is compromised. Calibration of the trachea and main bronchi is abnormal, with obstructed lumens. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated moderate wall thickening due to tumor presence. Lung parenchyma examination reveals normal densities without pleural sequelae, with minimal emphysematous changes in the lower zones. The appearance of branches in the right upper lobe is typical, while no focal density increases are observed in the basilar segments. A 4 mm non-detectable nodule is documented in the right lung. Abdominal imaging of the liver shows hyperdensity confirming perfusion abnormalities, while the spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are anomalous. Significant degenerative changes can be observed in the examined bones, maintaining vertebral corpus heights.
