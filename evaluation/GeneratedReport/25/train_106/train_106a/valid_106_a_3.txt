The heart contour and size appear abnormal, with evidence of pleural and pericardial effusion detected. The mediastinal main vascular structures are abnormal. There are no atheromatous plaques in the left coronary artery. Significant lymphadenopathies are noted in the prevascular, paratracheal, and subcarinal regions, with the largest lymph node in the paratracheal region measuring 27x35 mm and 35x25 mm in the subcarinal region. Pathological wall thickness increases in the esophagus are evident, while occlusive pathology is present in the trachea and both main bronchi. An endobronchial mass in the left lung upper lobe lingular segment bronchus shows limited extension towards the bronchi. The mass measures around 12 mm at its thickest point. The characteristics imply that the manifestation may be benign in nature. An irregular, smooth nodule of 15x20 mm is present in the left lung upper lobe lingular segment. There are no indications of distal airway disease. In both lungs, multiple clear areas without any significant nodules have been observed. Emphysematous changes are absent. The liver's size, contour, and parenchymal density are abnormal. A pathological mass was detected in the liver post-contrast. The renal assessment merits further examination, with detected abnormalities in the right kidney. Across the evaluated organs, discrete pathologies could indicate systemic issues rather than localized. Overall, laboratory findings are necessary for comprehensive assessment yet indicate stable conditions in the smaller structures.
