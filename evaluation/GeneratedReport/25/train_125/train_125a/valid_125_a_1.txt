The trachea and both main bronchi displayed no signs of occlusive pathology. However, extensive calcifications inconsistently noted are akin to tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica on the tracheal walls. The mediastinum was adequately assessed in the non-contrast study. The measurement of the ascending aorta demonstrated an anterior-posterior diameter of 46 mm, while the descending aorta measured 29 mm. The size of the pulmonary arteries appears smaller than normal. There was no enlargement of the heart. Significant pericardial effusion-thickening was documented. Atherosclerotic wall calcifications are absent in both the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries. The state of the aortic valve showed no calcification. The thoracic esophagus exhibited considerable wall thickening, deviating from what is expected. Notably enlarged lymph nodes were observed in prevascular and hilar-axillary regions with pathological dimensions. Motion artifacts significant impairment were noted in the imaging of the lung sections; physical changes within the sequence impact the right lung's middle lobe. Subpleural fat deposits were negligible in the posterolateral area of the right upper lobe with different sequelae. No mass lesion with clear borders was determined in either lung. Upon assessment, the upper abdominal organs appeared distinctly abnormal, with multiple significant lesions identifiable in the liver. There are no abnormalities within the bilateral adrenal kidneys, and a number of prominent spur formations connected on the left anterior corner of the vertebra at mid-thoracic. Sparse schmorl nodules were evident in the surrounding thoracic vertebrae.
