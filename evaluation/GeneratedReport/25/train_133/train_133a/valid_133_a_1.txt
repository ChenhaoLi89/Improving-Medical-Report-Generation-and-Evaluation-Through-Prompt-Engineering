The evaluation of the mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac assessment was optimal despite the absence of IV contrast. The mediastinal main vascular structures and heart contour exhibited abnormalities, with an enlarged heart size noted. Significant pericardial effusion-thickening was observed. The trachea and both main bronchi are constricted, showing signs of occlusive pathology within the lumen. When evaluating the thoracic esophagus, calibrations were found to be abnormal with notable pathological wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes were identified in sternal, pre-paratracheal, and subcarinal regions with bilateral hilar-axillary dimensions showing pathological enlargement. In the lung parenchyma, aeration was compromised, and numerous nodular lesions were detected throughout the lung tissue. Pleural effusion and thickening were noted. The upper abdominal organs included in the examination showed multiple abnormalities. A significant space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that involved the hepatic area. Additionally, the bilateral adrenal glands exhibited signs of enlargement and contained space-occupying lesions. The bone structures in the area studied were scanned, and vertebral corpus heights were diminished, indicating potential pathological conditions. Overall, the report presents several inconsistencies with the original findings which suggest a need for re-revaluation of the thoracic assessment.
