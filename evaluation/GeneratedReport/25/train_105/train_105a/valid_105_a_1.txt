The trachea and both main bronchi exhibit complete obstruction. Numerous calcific atheroma plaques are absent in the aorta and coronary arteries. The main vascular structures of the mediastinum and the heart's size and contour are abnormal. There is pericardial effusion with marked thickening noted. Calibration of the thoracic esophagus is significantly irregular and notable tumoral wall thickening is present. Enlarged lymph nodes are evident in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions with pathological dimensions observed. Examining the lung parenchyma window reveals normal lung conditions without any notable sequelae or changes. A significant localized nodular solid lesion is found in the upper lobe of the right lung, suspicious for infection rather than Covid-19 pneumonia. Two notable dense pulmonary nodules are clearly seen in the anterior segment of the right lung's upper lobe. Extensive normal condition changes with no signs of emphysema are observed in both lungs. Upper abdominal organs inspected are abnormal with multiple lesions detected in the liver across the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands show enlargement but are otherwise normal without any malignancy observed. Comforting degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine. Absence of any changes is reported in the cervical vertebral corpuscles. Immediate reevaluation of the patient is recommended based on previous examinations. If any critical concerns arise, urgent cervical MR treatment will likely be inappropriate in determining cervical metastasis.
