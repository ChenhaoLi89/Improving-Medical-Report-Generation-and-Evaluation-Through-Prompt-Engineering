The trachea and both main bronchi are narrowed. The mediastinum was optimally evaluated in the non-contrast examination. The observed mediastinal main vascular structures and heart contour demonstrated abnormalities with varying sizes detected. The thoracic aortaâ€™s diameter is enlarged. Significant pericardial effusion and thickening were noted. Thoracic esophageal calibration was abnormal, revealing considerable tumoral wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions were observed in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Examination of the lung parenchyma revealed abnormal aeration, with multiple nodular and infiltrative lesions identified within the lung tissue. Pleural effusion-thickening was present. Assessment of the upper abdominal organs included in the scans revealed notable abnormalities. A space-occupying lesion was found within the liver that intercepted the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands showed signs of enlargement with a significant space-occupying lesion present. In the left kidney, a 5mm hyperdense finding in the upper pole pelvicalyceal structure was deemed to be unrelated to calculus formation. The bone structures examined within the study area showed signs of destruction with diminished vertebral corpus heights. Overall, structural aberrations and abnormal findings persisted across various organ systems assessed in this examination.
