The trachea and both main bronchi exhibit signs of significant obstruction. The contour and size of the heart and mediastinal vascular structures are abnormal. A pleural effusion with an AP diameter measuring 35 mm was noted in the pericardial area, demonstrating an upward extension. The thoracic esophagus shows a narrow calibration, with considerable pathological wall thickening evident. Enlarged lymph nodes were confirmed in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions, indicating pathological enlargement. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window; aeration is severely diminished, and multiple nodular infiltrative lesions were detected in the lung parenchyma. There was a significant presence of pleural effusion thickening. The upper abdominal organs assessed were abnormal, and a space-occupying lesion was observed in the liver within the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands showed evidence of disease, and a sizable space-occupying lesion was identified. Bone structures throughout the study area showed abnormalities, with vertebral corpus heights reduced compared to normal rates. Overall, while certain thoracic and abdominal components appear within normal limits, there is clear evidence of abnormalities requiring further investigation in several regions of the body. Additionally, pleural inflammation was noted. Conclusion includes a recommendation for close monitoring of the observed anomalies for patient management.
