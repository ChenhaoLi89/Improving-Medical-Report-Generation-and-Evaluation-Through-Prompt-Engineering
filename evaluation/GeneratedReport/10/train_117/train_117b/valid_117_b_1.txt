The trachea and both main bronchi are patent. Mediastinal main vascular structures present typical findings. Heart size is normal. The diameter of the thoracic aorta appears temporal. Pericardial effusion and thickening were present. The thoracic esophagus shows marked narrowing, and significant tumoral wall thickening is noted. Multiple prominent lymph nodes are observed in the mediastinum, with some measuring calcific short axes up to 10 mm, revealing variances. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma window, numerous lesions measuring up to 20 x 18 mm have been found in the upper lobe of the left lung, primarily having well-defined borders, with no cavitation apparent in either lung. The liver and spleen sizes remain unchanged. Bone structures in the assessed region display normal density, and vertebral corpus heights are remarkably decreased. There were no anomalies noted within the connective tissue framework. The pulmonary vasculature appears significantly narrowed in certain areas, suggesting vascular compromise in varying distribution. Slightly enlarged mediastinal vessels encountering congestion around axillary regions could be indicative of upper body vascular remediation and distress, also notable as asymmetric patterns alter normal anatomy, leading to critical reflection on current observations. As a whole, lesions exhibiting irregular contours are suspect, requiring further observation for potential malignancies or an inflammatory process considering the overarching anatomical comparison with prior studies.
