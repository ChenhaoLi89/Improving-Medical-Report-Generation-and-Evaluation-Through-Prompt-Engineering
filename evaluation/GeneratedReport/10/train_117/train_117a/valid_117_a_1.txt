The trachea and both main bronchi appear to be normal, with no obstructive pathology identified. There is moderate bronchiectasis present in the central parts of both lungs, accompanied by significant emphysematous changes noted within both lungs. Linear atelectasis is frequently observed, and several nodules can be seen in each lung. In light of underlying disease, these nodules have raised concerns but seem non-metastatic in nature. The largest nodule is noted in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe, measuring about 18x22 mm at its widest point (series 2 section 134). No mass lesions or infiltrative pathological findings were detected within the pulmonary fields. Because contrast material was not administered, the mediastinal structures could not be adequately visualized. Based on available observations, heart size and contour are normal. Pleural or pericardial effusion was found to be present. There are atheroma plaques noted within the aorta and coronary vessels, and both mediastinal vascular structures are of normal dimension. It is hard to assess, but no signs of foreign bodies; however, a port chamber is noted in the right hemithorax, with the catheter ending approximately above the heart. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are absent in both the mediastinum and hilar regions. No abnormal wall thickening of the esophagus has been observed, nor are there signs of free fluid in the upper abdomen. No masses are appraised in the peritoneal or omental regions, and no fractures or destructive bone lesions are apparent in the assessed areas.
