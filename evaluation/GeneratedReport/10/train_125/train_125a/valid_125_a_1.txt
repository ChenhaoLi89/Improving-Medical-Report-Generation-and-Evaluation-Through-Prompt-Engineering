The evaluation of the trachea and both main bronchi revealed no significant occlusive pathology. Mild wall calcifications, indicative of tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica, were noted in the tracheal and bronchial walls. Although challenging, the mediastinal structures could somewhat be assessed; the anterior-posterior diameter of the ascending aorta was 30 mm, while the descending aorta measures 52 mm. The sizes of the pulmonary arteries appeared reduced. The heart size was normal with no evidence of pericardial effusion noted. Notable atherosclerotic wall calcifications were evident in the abdominal section. The aortic valve displayed signs of significant calcification. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus was abnormal, and considerable pathological thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary areas. Notably, significant atelectatic changes were observed throughout both lungs, especially in the superior segment of the right lung and the inferior lung lobe. Additionally, a decrease in subpleural adipose tissue was noted in the right lung. Multiple mass lesions with differentiable margins were present in the lung. Regarding the upper abdominal contents, they were found to be unremarkable. However, a sizeable lesion was detected in the liver's cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands displayed minimal abnormalities. Fragmented spur formations in the left posterior corner of the vertebral corpus were observed significantly, correlated with Schmorl's nodes in vertebral structures.
