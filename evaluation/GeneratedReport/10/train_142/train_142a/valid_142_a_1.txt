The trachea and main bronchi appear closed, showing no significant obstruction or unusual structural changes. There is a noticeable increase in wall thickness within the esophagus compared to previous assessments. Contrarily, pathologic lymphadenopathy (LAP) has been observed in the mediastinum. Heart and mediastinal vascular structures were adequately evaluated, revealing some abnormalities shaped by radiologic findings thankful to strong contrast use. There was evidence of pleural effusion-thickening present within both hemithoraces. A large active infiltration or mass lesion was noted in both lungs, alongside several millimetric nonspecific nodules. Emphysematous changes seem minor within the upper lobes of both lungs, though significant sequelae are evident in the right lung middle lobe lateral segment and the left lower lobe superior lingular segment. No pathology was evident in the examination of the areas passing through the lower abdomen. Additionally, numerous lytic or destructive lesions were encountered in the bony structures, suggesting potential pathological involvement. Further investigation is advised to determine the significance of these findings and facilitate management decisions moving forward. Monitoring and basal paraclinical evaluations may follow, ensuring no underlying conditions remain unnoticed. This center offers detailed follow-ups if necessary.
