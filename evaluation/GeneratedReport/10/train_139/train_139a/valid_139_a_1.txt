The trachea and both main bronchi are observed to be closed. The mediastinal main vascular structures, as well as the heart's contour and size, appear to be abnormal. A notable effusion with an AP diameter of 29 mm is present in the widest region of the pericardial area, which is directed towards the superior aspect. Evaluation of the thoracic esophagus reveals significant wall thickening, indicating a probable pathological process. Enlarged lymph nodes have been identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary areas, with diameters suggestive of pathology. An assessment in the lung parenchyma window indicates poor aeration of both lungs, with several nodular and infiltrative lesions detected throughout the parenchyma. Additionally, pleural effusion was evident along with thickening; therefore, further investigation is warranted. Examination of the upper abdominal organs included reveals multiple significant abnormalities. A prominent space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver within the cross-sectional view. Bilateral adrenal glands were found to be abnormal, and a distinct space-occupying lesion was identified on one side. The bone structures in the study area appear abnormal, with vertebral corpus heights demonstrated enhanced and preserved. Overall, this report presents various inconsistencies that would require further clinical correlation.
