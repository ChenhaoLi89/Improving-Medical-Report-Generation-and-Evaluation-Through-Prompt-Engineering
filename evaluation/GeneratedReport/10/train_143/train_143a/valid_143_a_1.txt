The trachea is positioned midline between both main bronchi, and significant obstructive pathology is evident in the lumen. Due to limitations of the non-contrast examination, optimal evaluation of the mediastinum was not possible. From the available assessment, the major vascular structures in the mediastinum, along with the cardiac contour and size, appear to be abnormal. An extensive pericardial effusion with notable thickening was observed. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus is abnormal, with major tumoral wall thickening identified. A sliding type hiatal hernia was identified at the lower end of the esophagus. Enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma, pleuroparenchymal fibroatelectasis sequelae changes are noted in the medial section of the middle lobe of the right lung. A mass lesion with indistinguishable borders, indicative of active infiltration, was identified in both lungs. The upper abdominal organs appear normal based on the observed sections; however, a significant space-occupying lesion was noted in the liver within the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands showed signs of severe irregularities with multiple space-occupying lesions detected. Additionally, moderate degenerative changes in the bone structures surrounding the examination area were noted, constituting a variety of clinical concerns for further review.
