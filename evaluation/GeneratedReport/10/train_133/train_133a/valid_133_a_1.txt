The evaluation of the mediastinal structures was limited due to prominent vascular elements and an examination of the heart conducted without intravenous contrast. The main vascular structures in the mediastinum exhibit abnormalities, and the heart's contour and size are significantly enlarged. A notable pericardial effusion-thickening is present, warranting further investigation. The trachea and both principal bronchi appear open with no obstructive pathology identified in their lumens. The thoracic esophagus is mildly dilated with significant pathological wall thickening observed. Enlarged lymph nodes were found in the prevascular and pre-paratracheal regions, with some measuring pathological dimensions. Review of the lung parenchyma window reveals reduced aeration; however, nodular or infiltrative lesions were identified within the lung tissues, along with mild pleural effusion-thickening. Evaluation of the upper abdominal organs revealed several abnormalities, and a substantial space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that occupied a portion of the cross-sectional area. The bilateral adrenal glands appear abnormal with several lesions present. Additionally, there are significant differences in the bone structures analyzed, with vertebral corpus heights diminished. Overall, while some aspects of normal findings are noted, the existence of abnormalities throughout the assessment serves as an alert for possible underlying conditions that may require further clinical attention.
