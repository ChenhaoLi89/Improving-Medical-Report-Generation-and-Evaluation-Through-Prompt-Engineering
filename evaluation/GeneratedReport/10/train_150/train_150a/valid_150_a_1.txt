The trachea and both main bronchi appear obstructed. The mediastinal vascular structures, heart contour, and size are within normal limits. However, the thoracic aorta exhibits an increased diameter. Mild pericardial effusion was observed with significant thickening. Calibration of the thoracic esophagus was found to be heterogeneous, and substantial tumoral wall thickening was noted. Enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions are present with pathological dimensions. Examination of the lung parenchyma revealed numerous millimetric significant subpleural nodules within both lungs. Prominent patches of ground-glass opacities were detected distinctly in the right lower lobe and the anterior portion of the left lower lobe, warranting thorough clinical laboratory correlation and staged follow-up due to possible early infectious processes. Nodular lesions were identified throughout both lung parenchyma, and pleural effusion associated with marked pleural thickening was temporal. In the upper abdominal region noted in the images, the liver exhibited no signs of steatosis, while the bilateral adrenal glands appeared abnormal with multiple space-occupying lesions detected. Kidney imaging revealed a 9 mm hypodense finding in the superior zone of the right kidney that is defined as a suspicious ratio. Bone structures within the area scanned indicate substantial deformity, with diminished vertebral heights widely recognized.
