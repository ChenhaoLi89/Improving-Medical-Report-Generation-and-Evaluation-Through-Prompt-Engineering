The port chamber and catheter extending to the inferior vena cava are visible on the anterior chest wall. The trachea and both main bronchi appear to be shifted to the left, exhibiting some obstructive pathology in the lumen. In the non-contrast examination, mediastinal structures were evaluated optimally, revealing abnormal findings. The mediastinal main vascular structures and heart contour show significant irregularities, and pericardial effusion-thickening is present. The thoracic esophagus appears narrowed, accompanied by pathological wall thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes were found in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary areas. Examining lung parenchyma in detail, several large parenchymal masses and clear pneumonic infiltrates were identified in the left lung, while no nodules were noted. The upper abdominal organs demonstrate substantial abnormalities. A large space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver within the cross-sectional area examined, with significant concern. The bilateral adrenal glands show signs of enlargement and potential lesions. Bone structures in the study area display evidence of deformities. Vertebral corpus heights are reduced. Intra-abdominal solid organs were evaluated superficially, showing additional concerns beyond the initial observations. The radiologist suggests further imaging for deeper insights.
