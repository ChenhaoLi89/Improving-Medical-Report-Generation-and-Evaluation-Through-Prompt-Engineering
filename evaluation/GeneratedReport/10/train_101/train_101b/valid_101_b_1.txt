The trachea and both main bronchi were also found slightly deviated to the left, with obstructive pathology noted in the lumen. The mediastinum was well-evaluated in the non-contrast examination. Calibration of mediastinal main vascular structures appeared highly abnormal. Atherosclerotic wall calcifications were particularly noted in the abdominal aorta only, while coronary arteries appeared clear. Heart size was reported to be diminished. The mitral valve exhibited normal calcification, while the aortic valve showed no concerns. Significant pericardial effusion was identified as thickened layers were observed. The thoracic esophagus displayed irregular calibration with notable significant tumoral wall thickening. No enlarged lymph nodes were discovered in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary dimensions. When examining the lung parenchyma, severe peribronchial thickening was documented in both lungs' peripheral areas. Emphysematous changes were predominantly noted in the left lung only, and no bulla formations were present. The right hemidiaphragm was observed to be depressed. Affected segments in the lesser lobes of both lungs were seen, with mass lesions suggesting active infiltration detected in the lower-fraction mid zones. There is a likely abscess instead of a cyst identified in the first stages of assessment. A millimetric simple cortical cyst was detected in the upper pole of the right kidney instead of the left. However, bilateral adrenal size appeared decreased, with no lesions discerned. Osteoporosis was minimally evident, although vertebral corpus heights noted moderate reductions.
