The examination was performed without contrast, and the evaluation of the mediastinal structures were found to be optimal. The trachea, along with the lumen of both main bronchi, appears partially obstructed. An occlusive pathology was identified in the trachea and thoracic lumens. The major vascular structures in the mediastinum exhibited abnormalities. Significant calcific atherosclerotic changes were noted in the walls of the thoracic abdominal artery and both coronary arteries. The heart size was found to be diminished (no cardiomegaly detected). Mild pleural thickening and effusion were revealed. Esophageal measurements were abnormal in several sections, with significant pathological wall thickening relevant to the findings. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were identified in both mediastinal and hilar regions. Upon reviewing the lung parenchyma, prominent peribronchial thickening was seen throughout the lungs. Additionally, pulmonary fibrotic changes were noticeable in both lungs. Compared to previous examinations, an increase in the size and number of specific parenchymal nodules were observed, with the largest measuring 8 mm in the upper lobe of the right lung. Extensive mass infiltration was identified in the lung parenchyma. No abnormalities were detected in pleuroparenchymal sequelae density; degenerative cysts in both lungs were plotted as normal findings. Furthermore, overall the upper abdominal sections were outside the normal limits for a non-contrast examination. A previously inconspicuous simple cyst was documented in the lower pole of the right kidney. The calibration of bilateral adrenal glands was elevated, and multiple space-occupying lesions were found. Lytic-destructive lesions were present in bone structures.
