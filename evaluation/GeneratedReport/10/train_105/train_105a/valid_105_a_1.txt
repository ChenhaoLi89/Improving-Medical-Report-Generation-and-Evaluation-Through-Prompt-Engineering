The trachea and both primary bronchi are open. Marked calcific atheroma plaques are noted exclusively in the aorta without involvement of the coronary arteries. The mediastinal vascular structures and the contour and size of the heart are found to be normal. A significant pericardial effusion was noted. The thoracic esophagus is narrowed slightly, but no significant tumoral thickening of the wall is identified. There are enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, and bilateral hilar regions indicative of possible pathology. During examination of the lung parenchyma window, prominent abnormalities, specifically apical segment consolidation, are noted in the lower lobes of both lungs.  An ante flexion on the right lung main stem bronchus reveals a localized nodular opacity suggestive of pneumonia due to viral infection. There are three clearly defined and structural pulmonary nodules under situational analysis in the upper lobe segment of the left lung. Localized emphysematous conditions are limited to the right lung only. The upper abdominal organs within the examined sections show minor irregularities, primary liver lesions have been ruled out. Neither of the bilateral adrenal glands presents abnormalities or lesions. Only minor thinning is present within the thoracic vertebrae, with prevalent osteophytic formation in lumbar regions, although no sclerotic alterations were observed in cervical vertebral bodies. Further evaluation alongside previous examinations is recommended for thorough assessment, especially considering the necessity for cervical imaging to investigate potential metastases.
