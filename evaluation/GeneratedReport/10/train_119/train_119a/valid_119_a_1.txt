The trachea and both main bronchi are patent, with no occlusive pathology noted. There is a pathological increase in wall thickness in the thoracic esophagus, and a significant sliding type hiatal hernia is observed at the lower end. Unfortunately, the evaluation of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac examination was limited due to insufficient IV contrast. Calcified atheromatous plaques are evident within the thoracic aorta, while the ascending aorta demonstrates aneurysmatic dilatation measured at 29 mm. The cardiac contours and size appear normal, with notable pericardial and pleural effusion present. In the mediastinum, enlarged lymph nodes in both axillary regions with abnormal characteristics were detected. Upon assessment of the lung parenchyma, no active infiltration or mass lesions are present in either lung, although emphysematous changes were detected mainly in the lower lobes. Marked bronchiectasis was noted in the bronchial structures of both lungs, predominantly on the right-sided. Peribronchial diffuse thickening is observed. Several millimeter-sized specific nodules are noted in both lungs. Within the upper abdomen, a 28x20 mm lesion consistent with benign tissue was identified in the left adrenal gland, potentially a low-density adenoma. No hyperdense stones were located in either kidney, and intraabdominal fluid collections were present. Pathological lymph nodes were identified within the intraabdominal cavity, while no lytic or destructive lesions are apparent in the bony structures referred to in the imaging study.
