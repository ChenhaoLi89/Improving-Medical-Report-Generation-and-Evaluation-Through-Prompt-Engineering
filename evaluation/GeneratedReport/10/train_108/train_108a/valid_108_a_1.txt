The trachea and both main bronchi appear obstructed, indicating occlusive pathology within the airways. A significant pathological increase in wall thickness is evident in the thoracic esophagus. Unfortunately, medial vascular structures and cardiac examination cannot be fully assessed due to the presence of adequate contrast. The dimensions of mediastinal vessels and the heart shape suggest abnormality in size. Pericardial and pleural effusions were not identified during the scan. Markedly dulled atheromatous plaques dot the walls of the aorta and coronary arteries. Pathological lymph nodes were detected in both axillary areas, at the supraclavicular level, and within the mediastinum. Reviewing the lung parenchyma window revealed substantial active infiltration and new mass lesions identified in both lungs. Moderate bronchiectasis presents prominently in both lungsâ€™ peripherals. There is a notable absence of emphysematous changes across varying lung regions. The evaluation shows uniform density without any signs suggesting structural degradation or volume alteration, including the regions around both lung apices. An enhance in height is particularly observed in the upper end plateau of the T3 vertebra in the imaged structures. Vertebra corpus experiences significant alterations in anteroposterior dimensions indicating vertebral stability. Overall, the depicted conditions raise concerns, suggesting potential serious underlying conditions requiring further clinical correlation for diagnostic confirmation.
