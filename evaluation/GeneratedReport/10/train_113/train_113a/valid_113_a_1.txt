The conducting tissue organization (CTO) is noted to be beyond the normal range. The calibration of the main mediastinal vascular structures appears abnormal. There is no thymic tissue present in the anterior mediastinum, and hypodense areas typically associated with muscle formation are visible. Enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum exhibiting pathological size and configuration have been detected. Additionally, while both hemithoraxes are noted to be symmetrical, evaluation reveals an abnormal calibration of the trachea and main bronchi, which show partial occlusion. The thoracic esophagus demonstrates significant irregularities with notable tumoral wall thickening. Pathological lymph nodes were spotted in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. Upon inspection of the lung parenchyma window, no nodules were found within the interlobar fissure of the right lung; however, minor findings consistent with a mild bacterial infection were noted. Evaluating upper abdominal organs revealed the lack of density suggestive of calculi in the left kidney. Furthermore, bilateral adrenal glands exhibited considerable abnormalities, and multiple space-occupying lesions were detected in adjacent areas. Degenerative changes were extensive in bone structures throughout the area examined.
