A notable incidence of unilateral gynecomastia was reported. The trachea and both main bronchi were positioned off-center, with significant obstructive pathology observed in the lumen. During the non-contrast examination, optimal evaluation of the mediastinal region was attained. The assessment showed mediastinal vascular structures, heart contour, and size to be abnormal. Mild pericardial effusion and thickening were present. In the coronary arteries, there was absence of stent material. The thoracic esophagus exhibited abnormal calibration with significant pathological wall thickening detected. Enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the prevascular and pre-paratracheal regions, suspicious for pathology. Through the lung parenchyma window, segmentary tubular bronchiectasis with notable peribronchial enlargements were seen in both lungs. The most distinct interlobular septal thickening and subpleural lines, along with evident ground glass opacities and a dense appearance, were present in the lower lobe basal segments of both lungs. The findings were initially suggestive of post-infectious changes unassociated with Covid-19 pneumonia. No pleuroparenchymal fibroatelectasis changes were evident in the lingular segment of the left lung or bilaterally. Parenchymal nodules measuring 5.2 mm were identified only in the right lung. Mass lesions associated with active infiltration with clear outlines were detected in both lungs. Imaging of the upper abdominal organs appeared abnormal, with a significant space-occupying lesion detected in the liver. Evidence of advanced osteodegenerative changes was notable in an extensive area of bone structures.
