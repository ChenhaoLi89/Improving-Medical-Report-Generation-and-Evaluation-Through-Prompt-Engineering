The trachea and both main bronchi are clear, indicating unobstructed airways. The vascular structures in the mediastinum, as well as the heart's shape and dimensions, appear abnormal. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is observed to be narrowed. There was a notable pericardial effusion-thickening identified. The thoracic esophagus shows changes suggesting significant tumoral wall thickening. No enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions were noted within pathological size criteria. Upon inspecting the lung parenchyma, normal aeration is reported, with the presence of nodular lesions observed. There is no pleural effusion or thickening documented. The examined upper abdominal organs are irregular, with evidence of space-occupying lesions noted in the liver throughout the cross-sectional area. The liver parenchyma shows no diffuse alterations associated with steatosis. The bilateral adrenal glands appear parafunctioning, with no lesions detected. The bone structures appear abnormal on imaging, indicating degeneration. The vertebral corpus heights exhibit marked compression, raising concerns for sustained vertebral integrity through the evaluated segment. This contrast in findings necessitates further clinical correlation and may lead to the recommendation of additional evaluation or management strategies.
