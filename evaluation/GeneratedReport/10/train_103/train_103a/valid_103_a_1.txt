The trachea and both main bronchi appear clear, with no evidence of obstructive pathology detected. Evaluation of the mediastinal structures was performed but deemed unsuitable due to the unenhanced nature of the examination. The thoracic main vascular structures appeared to have significant abnormalities. Heart size is diminished, and pericardial effusion is noted. No prosthetic material is present in the aortic valve, and there is no post-op suture material on the wall of the ascending aorta. The thoracic esophagus shows some areas of significant wall thickening that raise concerns. Enlarged lymph nodes, measuring 12x7 mm, were detected in various locations such as the prevascular and paratracheal regions. When assessing both lung parenchyma windows, no abnormalities were noted; thus, patchy areas suggest a post-operative state leading to air trapping. Smooth interseptal thickenings are observed more prominently in the upper lobes of both lungs, indicating prior inflammation. Bilateral pleural effusion is noted, with fluid measurements of 10 mm on the right and 20 mm on the left. The severity of fissures in both lungs was normal. Both lungs exhibited significant mass lesions within normal limits. The upper abdominal components were demonstrated to have some anomalies. The calibration of the bilateral adrenal glands was found to be altered, and space-occupying lesions were acquired. There is evidence of metallic suture material in the sternum, with no bone lesions evident on imaging.
