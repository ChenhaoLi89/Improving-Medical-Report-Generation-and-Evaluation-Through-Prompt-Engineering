The cardiac silhouette remains unchanged with signs of reduction. The mediastinal major vascular structures appear abnormal. Diameter of the thoracic aorta is enlarged. A notable pericardial effusion and thickening were observed. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus was abnormal, and significant tumoral wall thickening was noted. There is no evidence of a hiatal hernia. Several lymph nodes exhibiting pathological size and configuration were detected at the mediastinal and hilar levels. Upon examining lung parenchyma, both hemithorax show asymmetry. The trachea and main bronchi have irregular calibrations, with multiple lumens showing high density. Numerous areas of parenchyma consolidation and ground glass opacities were found primarily in the right lung. Bilateral pleural effusion is evident with minor signs of pneumothorax present on left. Soft tissue planes are undisturbed and show no abnormalities. Degenerative changes noted in the bone structure are moderate and localized. Summary findings indicate the presence of significant anomalies but overall, none warrant urgent clinical intervention. It is recommended to conduct follow-up imaging as trends often change in similar presentations. Routine imaging would assist in assessing long-term progress while considering clinical correlations on symptoms.
