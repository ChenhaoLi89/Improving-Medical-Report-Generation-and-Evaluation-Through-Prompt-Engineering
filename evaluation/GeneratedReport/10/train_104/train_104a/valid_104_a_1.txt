The trachea and both main bronchi are observed to be partially occluded. The main vascular structures in the mediastinum, along with the contour and size of the heart, are noted to be abnormal. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is enlarged. There is evidence of pericardial effusion-thickening present. No calcific plaques are found in the coronary arteries. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus appears to be abnormal, and significant tumoral wall thickening has been detected. Enlarged lymph nodes with pathological dimensions are identified in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions. A detailed examination of the lung parenchyma reveals significant bronchiectasis present at the central level in both lungs, along with infiltrates detected in the lung parenchyma. There is a substantial pleural effusion-thickening observed. Regarding the upper abdominal organ evaluation, marked density preservation is evident in the liver. There are no stones found in the gallbladder. The thoracic vertebrae are clear of osteophytes, although moderate fibrotic densities are noted in the adjacent lung parenchyma. Overall, the findings suggest mixed responses in the thoracic cavity and abdominal evaluations that warrant further investigation.
