The trachea and both main bronchi are patent. Radiologic evaluation revealed unremarkable findings for the trachea and both bronchi. Lung ventilation is compromised, and indications of masses or infiltrating lesions were noted within both lungs. Mediastinal structures cannot be adequately assessed due to the absence of contrast material. Observationally, the contour of the heart is abnormal, suggesting potential enlargement. Pleural and pericardial effusions are present. The dimensions of the mediastinal vascular structures display pathological enlargement. Enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the mediastinum and hilar regions, indicating possible lymphadenopathy. No significant wall thickening was identified in the esophagus. A minimal sliding type hiatal hernia is noted at the lower segment of the esophagus. There is no evidence of fluid accumulation in the upper abdominal cavity, and no lymph nodes of concerning dimensions were seen. Based on the observations in this examination, borderline masses with indistinct margins were found in the upper abdominal organs. The assessment confirmed the presence of fractures or lytic-destructive lesions in the bone structures illuminated in the sections. Overall, the investigation provided a mixed set of findings, influencing the diagnostic clarity and leading to considerations for further evaluation.
