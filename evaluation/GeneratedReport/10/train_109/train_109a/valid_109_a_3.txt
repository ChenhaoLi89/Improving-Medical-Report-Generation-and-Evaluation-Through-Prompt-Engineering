The evaluation revealed no lymph nodes within the supraclavicular fossa or axilla that exhibited pathological sizes or characteristics. The sternotomy line remained intact, and the findings from the prior bypass surgery were noted for comparison. A moderate pericardial effusion was identified, attributed to postoperative changes, though the size of the heart appeared unchanged. Several specific lymph nodes were detected in the mediastinal area, indicating potential lymphatic involvement. The examination of lung parenchyma through the window revealed a pleural effusion measuring approximately 6.5 cm in diameter between the right pleural leaves. Adjacent to this effusion, areas of pneumonic infiltration were observed in the lung parenchyma, as well as multiple suspicious nodular lesions detected within the aerated lung tissue. No significant abnormalities were noted in the upper abdominal sections, suggesting absence of organic pathologies. Furthermore, findings indicate dramatic improvements in the bone structures, showing signs of healthy regeneration without any degenerative changes. Consequently, these results warrant continuous monitoring and further evaluation to assess underlying conditions while considering treatment options based on the identified abnormalities.
