The evaluation of mediastinal structures was suboptimal due to the lack of an enhancement process during the examination. No significant obstruction was found in the trachea and the lumina of both main bronchi. An have been observed of a catheter extending inferiorly behind the vena cava. The sizes of thoracic vascular structures appeared natural. However, dilatation was detected in the thoracic aorta. The heart size was within the normal range. No pericardial thickening or effusion was present. Evaluation of the thoracic esophagus showed typical calibration with no major pathological wall thickening. Compared to previous evaluations, stable conglomerated lymphadenopathies were noted in the mediastinum, specifically within the upper-lower paratracheal regions, subcarinal area, and right paratracheal-right hilar proximity; the largest lymph node demonstrated a short axis of 25 mm in diameter. When assessed in the lung parenchyma window, bilateral peribronchial thickenings were detected. Notably, significant regression was observed in the nodular consolidation areas in both lungs. Additionally, between the bilateral pleural layers, areas of free pleural effusion with thickness measurements of 40 mm on the right and 25 mm on the left were identified. Furthermore, the examination didn't reveal the expected effusion in the pericardial area. In upper abdominal imaging, two hypodense lesions measuring 25 mm were found in liver segments 7 and 9; these were unchanged compared to the prior examination. Overall, no significant changes in other reported findings were noted at this time.
