A catheter image extending from the left internal jugular vein to the left atrium was observed. No occlusive pathology was detected in the oral cavity and lung spaces of both left main bronchi. The mediastinum could be effectively evaluated in the non-contrast study. Overview of mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, and size appeared abnormal. An extensive effusion was observed in the pericardial space. Thoracic esophagus calibration was abnormal, and significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were noted. Upon examination of the lung parenchyma window, peribronchial thickenings, centriacinar nodules, and ground glass areas were observed only in the right lung of the patient, who was being monitored for atelectasis. Furthermore, a nodular consolidation area was noted in the left lung lower lobe anterobasal segment. Stable hypodense lesions measuring 15 mm in diameter were observed in liver segments 3 and 4 on upper abdominal CT scans. Calculus was observed in the kidney. Differences were noted in other findings in the current examination. In summary, this report indicates new abnormalities that were not present in prior evaluations. Further clinical correlation is recommended for definitive interpretation and management.
