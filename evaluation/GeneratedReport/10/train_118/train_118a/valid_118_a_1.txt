Both main bronchi demonstrate partial obstruction, with indicative pathology observed in the trachea. A thorough evaluation of mediastinal structures revealed optimal conditions due to the examination being enhanced. Calibration of the larger major vascular structures was abnormal, and the heart contour appeared enlarged. Severe pericardial thickening and clinically significant effusion were also noted. The thoracic esophagus showed significant pathological wall thickening, and lymphadenopathies were observed only in the subclavian areas, with the largest measuring 10 mm and appearing scattered rather than conglomerate. Examination of lung parenchyma highlighted bilateral peribronchial thickenings; however, no nodular consolidations were present in either lung. Ground glass density increases were absent entirely, and fungal infections were discarded as a differential diagnosis. A clinical-laboratory correlation is deemed unnecessary in this case. Urinary stones were absent, but instead, mild calcifications were noted in both kidneys. In the spleen, numerous hypodense lesions of varied sizes were observed. Unexpectedly, benign appearances were noted during characterizations in the examination. Finally, signs of both massive lytic-destructive lesions and normality were detected within the bone structures. Further definitive diagnosis and follow-up evaluations are required to clarify all observed findings throughout the report thoroughly.
