The recent examination revealed a notable increase in density and variability within the mediastinal fatty planes attributed to post-treatment effects. The trachea and the lumens of both main bronchi remain patent, with no obstructions detected in either area. The thoracic vascular structures are naturally calibrated, while mild dilatation was noted in the thoracic aorta. The heart contour is categorized as enlarged. There was no evidence of pericardial thickening or effusion detected. The thoracic esophagus demonstrated a normal caliber, with no significant hypertrophy of the wall. In evaluating the lung parenchyma, a soft tissue density previously noted in the paramediastinal region of the left upper lobe showed marked progression since the last study. When examined, shoe box appearances were noted with evident diffuse emphysematous changes and a decrease in density within the interstitial pattern throughout both lungs. There were notable improvements in atelectasis observed in the lower lobe of the right lung. The latest findings indicate minimal consolidations seen in the right lung lobes; however, multiple areas of infiltrative changes appeared in the lower lobe of the left lung, indicating potential infection. It is now recommended to correlate these findings with clinical and laboratory data. The upper abdominal examination showcased calcified lesions consistent with fibrosis in the liver, and their detailed nature cannot fully be determined due to lack of contrast. Additionally, a localized absence of fluid was noted, separately verifying previous imaging, suggesting stable imaging characteristics overall.  Subsequently, widespread areas of healthy bone structures emerged remarkably throughout the upper abdomen.
