The mediastinum was assessed using a non-contrast examination, showing suboptimal evaluation. The trachea appears to be displaced laterally towards the left main bronchus, with no evidence of obstructive pathology within the lumen. A notable mass is now observed obliterating the left lower-middle lobe bronchus, while the right upper lobe bronchus is markedly narrowed. The heart's silhouette, size, and the main vascular structures within the mediastinal region are within normal limits. Notably, there are no calcifications detected within the coronary arteries. Moderate effusion was noted in the pericardial space, accompanied by considerable thickening of the pericardium. A normal thoracic esophageal calibration was recorded, and no significant pathological wall thickness was seen. There were a few lymph nodes present, especially in the right lower paratracheal area and aortopulmonary regions, with the largest measuring 10 mm in diameter. Additionally, an anky effusion was incidentally found in the left pleural space with a temporary thickness of 15 mm. When analyzed, the lung parenchyma demonstrated minor consolidation areas, smooth interlobular septal thickenings, and several nodules; however, the right lower lobes remained unobstructed. In the assessment of upper abdominal organs, the liver showed clusters of nodules solely, while both adrenal glands were confirmed to be normal. No signs of significant lesions were observed in the bone structures within the examined scope.
