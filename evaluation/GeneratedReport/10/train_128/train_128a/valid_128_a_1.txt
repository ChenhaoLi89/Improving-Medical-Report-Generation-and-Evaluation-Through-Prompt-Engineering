The overall assessment indicates a normal case of CTO. The ascending aorta measures at 41 mm, which falls within normal limits. The descending aorta appears slightly narrowed. The aortic arch measures 32 mm, which is consistent with normal anatomy. Calibration of other mediastinal major vascular structures is unremarkable. No catheter appearance is noted in the superior vena cava. Calcific atheroma plaques are observed in the aortic arch and the renal arteries. There is evidence of at least one enlarged lymph node in the mediastinum. Lymph nodes are observed at both hilar levels, exhibiting pathological configurations. The calibration of the thoracic esophagus shows a marked increase in wall thickness. In assessing the lungs, the trachea and main bronchi show normal diameters, although prominent bronchovascular sheaths are seen in several lung segments. There are sequelae changes with notable emphysematous density reductions observed mainly along the lower lobes. A new, stable nodule with a size of approximately 3 mm is noted in the posterior segment of the left lung upper lobe. A small nodule of 5.5 mm is also seen in the right lower lobe, along with additional nodular lesions mobilizable between various lung compartments, which are reported as stable in previous evaluations. Gallbladder appears markedly contracted and should be evaluated further; other abdominal structures are unremarkable. There appear to be degenerative alterations in several vertebrae. Fracture appearances within the right-sided lower ribs are noted, signaling possible prior trauma rather than new injuries.
