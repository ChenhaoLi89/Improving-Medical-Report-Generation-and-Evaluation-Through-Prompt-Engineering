A mass measuring 3 cm is identified in the thickest portion of the left lung, fully surrounding the pleura at its apex. There are effusion areas measuring 53 mm in the space between the pleural leaves on the left, without any signs of loculation. In the upper lobe of the left lung, a decrease in reticular density with regular borders is noted, incompatible with lymphangitic spread. Additionally, a consolidation area in the lower lobe displays air bronchograms and no atelectatic changes. There are regular thickenings observed in the mediastinal pleura. Soft tissue densities located in the lower paratracheal region measure about 26x30 mm, showcasing a firm appearance and necrotic lymphadenopathy. Furthermore, there are normal lymphadenopathies distributed throughout the upper-paratracheal, subcarinal paraesophageal, and left hilar regions, with the smallest measuring 5 cm on the long axis. Emphysematous changes are pronounced in the left lung only. Interstitial fibrosis and bulla formation are documented in the lower lobe of the right lung, which contributes to volume loss. Millimetric parenchymal nodules are observed in both the upper and middle lobes of the right lung. A 10 mm diameter parenchymal nodule was also noted in the upper lobe of the left lung. In the examination of upper abdominal organs highlighted, there are no lymphadenopathies detected at the level of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. Bone structures assessed are anomalous. Vertebral corpus height anomalies are present.
