The trachea and both main bronchi were centered and an obstructive pathology was identified in the lumen. In the preliminary examination, the mediastinum was evaluated suboptimally. However, mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, and size appear normal. A significant pericardial effusion-thickening was observed. The thoracic esophagus showed abnormal calibration, with notable tumoral wall thickening detected. Enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions were recorded, indicating pathological dimensions. Examination of the lung parenchyma revealed reticulonodular sequela fibrotic density increases solely in the right lung apex. Active infiltration with well-defined borders was detected in both lungs suggesting abnormal mass lesions. The visualized upper abdominal organs were found to be abnormal, indicating possible underlying pathology. A significant space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver within the analyzed cross-sectional area. Meanwhile, the bilateral adrenal glands showed signs of abnormal growth, with space-occupying lesions confirmed. Bone structures in the study area were slightly abnormal, with preserved vertebral corpus heights noticeably changed. Overall, the study indicates extensive findings that require further clinical attention and follow-up imaging to assess the observed abnormalities.
