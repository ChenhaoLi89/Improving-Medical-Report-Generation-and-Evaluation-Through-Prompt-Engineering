The trachea and both main bronchi are patent with no evidence of obstructive pathology affecting them. There are significant pleuroparenchymal changes noted in both lung apexes. Emphysematous changes in both lungs are prominent, and multiple nodules perceived in both lungs measure approximately 6 mm in diameter, with the largest located in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the left lung. A mass or infiltrative lesion is present within both lungs. The mediastinal structures cannot be thoroughly evaluated due to the lack of contrast material. Observational findings indicate an abnormal heart contour and size. Additionally, observed pleural and pericardial effusions are present, while the mediastinal main vascular structures appear widened. Some enlarged pathologically lymph nodes were detected within the mediastinum and hilar regions. An increase in pathological wall thickness in the esophagus was observed in chaotic delineation whereas no upper abdominal free fluid collections appear within the sections reviewed. Enlarged lymph nodes of substantial dimensions were identified within the examined region. There is a discernible mass with clear borders present in upper abdominal organs as inferred from the non-enhanced CT. The thoracic vertebral corpus heights, alignments, and densities show notable abnormalities. Preservation of intervertebral disc spaces is absent, and neural foramina appear closed. There are however extensive lytic-destructive lesions found within the bone structures noted in these sections.
