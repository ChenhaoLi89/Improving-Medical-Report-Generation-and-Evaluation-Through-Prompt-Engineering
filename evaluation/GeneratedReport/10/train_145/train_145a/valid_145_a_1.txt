The trachea and both main bronchi appear to be obstructed. However, the mediastinum was evaluated optimally during the non-contrast examination. The mediastinal main vascular structures and the heart's contour and size were found to be abnormal. Additionally, the thoracic aorta showed an increased diameter. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion or thickening. Assessment of the thoracic esophagus revealed significant tumoral wall thickening present, but no enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary areas exceeding pathological dimensions were identified. In the lung parenchyma window, aeration of both lung parenchyma is abnormal, and multiple nodular and infiltrative lesions were detected throughout the lung tissue. A moderate pleural effusion-thickening is present. Regarding the upper abdominal organs viewed in the sections, findings are unremarkable. No significant space-occupying lesion was identified in the liver. The right adrenal gland appears enlarged, and there is a noted space-occupying lesion. The left kidney exhibits mild hypodense findings in the upper pole pelvicalyceal structure, which was interpreted as likely non-calculous. Evaluating the bone structures in the area studied shows some abnormalities, and vertebral corpus heights are reduced.
