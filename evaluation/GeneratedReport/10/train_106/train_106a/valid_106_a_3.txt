The evaluation of the heart reveals normal contour and size, with no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion. Mediastinal vascular structures appear normal as well. Significant atheroma plaques are identified in the left major coronary artery. The presence of lymphadenopathy is noted in the prevascular, paratracheal, and subcarinal areas, with the largest measuring 27x35 mm in the subcarinal region and 34x26 mm in the paratracheal area. The esophagus shows an increased pathological wall thickness within the observed sections, while both the trachea and bronchi are clear of occlusive pathology. There is, however, a large endobronchial mass located in the right lung's upper lobe, with dimensions approximated at 14 mm, potentially indicating primary or metastatic lung malignancy. Additionally, a previously missed irregular nodule in the posterior segment of the left lung upper lobe measures approximately 15x19 mm. Airway branching appears normal, ruling out emphysema. The liver and spleen exhibit normal contours and densities, with no evidence of lesions. The pancreas and both adrenal glands also appear normal with the exception of a 52x70 mm mass found in the right adrenal gland. Kidney sizes and structures are within normal limits, and the bladder shows no abnormalities besides a minor polypoid lesion. Vascular structures are intact without significant atheroma presence, and anatomical ruler heights in the spine are normal. Observable conditions in the intestines showed anatomical enhancement, with no free intraabdominal fluid seen.
