The trachea was positioned off-center of both main bronchi, and significant obstructive pathology was observed in the lumen. The mediastinum could not be adequately evaluated due to the non-contrast examination. Based on the visible structures, the mediastinal main vascular features and the heart's size and contour appeared abnormal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was noted. The thoracic esophagus calibration was abnormal, and significant pathological wall thickening was detected. A paraesophageal hernia was identified near the upper end of the esophagus. Enlarged lymph nodes were found in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, and bilateral hilar-axillary regions exhibiting pathological dimensions. In the lung parenchyma window, several parenchymal nodules measuring over 5 mm in diameter were noted in the right lung. In addition to this, there were several mass lesions with active infiltration that were detected in both lungs. The upper abdominal organs viewed in the computed tomography sections appeared abnormal. A space-occupying lesion was observed in the liver that extended into the surrounding tissue. The bilateral adrenal glands displayed abnormalities, with space-occupying lesions detected. Furthermore, no scoliosis was noted, and vertebral corpus heights were considerably reduced.
