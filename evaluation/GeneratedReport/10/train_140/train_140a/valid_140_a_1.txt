The imaging results revealed no critical pathology within the trachea or the lumens of both main bronchi. The effectiveness of the non-contrast examination on the mediastinum was limited; however, the visible main vascular structures and heart outline appear normal, with no evidence of pericardial effusion. Notably, a significant amount of calcific atheroma plaques is present in the ascending aorta. Evaluation of the thoracic esophagus indicated normal caliber and without relevant wall thickening. There was an absence of enlarged lymphadenopathy in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary territories. Upon investigating the lung parenchyma, a single reasonably prominent emphysematous transformation was seen, along with minimal fibrotic discrepancies. An old fracture in the 10th rib on the left side and ground-glass consolidations appeared indefinite in the surrounding parenchyma. Noteworthy are stable millimetric nodules in the lung fields, which require monitoring but show no concerning characteristics. Mild atrophy and irregularity in the contours of the liver were identified in the right lobe. The spleen appeared diminished. Notably, there were no cysts identified in either kidney. Vertebral degeneration was noted, with spur formations observed in the upper regions of several lumbar vertebrae existing beyond the imaged section.
