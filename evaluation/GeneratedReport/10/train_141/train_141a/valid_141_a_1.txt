The CT assessment reveals that the central airway passages, including the trachea and both primary bronchi, are unobstructed. The main vascular structures within the mediastinum, along with the contour and dimensions of the heart, are found to be within normal limits. The diameter of the thoracic aorta is abnormally enlarged. There is noted presence of pericardial effusion-thickening. The thoracic esophagus appears distended with significant tumoral wall thickening evident. No enlarged lymph nodes in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions were detected on the scan. Examination of the lung parenchyma reflects that aeration is impaired, and several nodular lesions are identified within the lung fields. No pleural effusion-thickening was observed. The analysis of the upper abdominal structures shows no nodular formation compatible with the abnormal accessory spleen near the spleen. Instead, a hyperdense lesion is seen in the left kidney that is suggestive of a malignant growth. Marked degenerative changes were noted in the regionâ€™s bony structures without evidence of trauma. Overall, the imaging findings point towards various conditions needing further monitoring and possible intervention while other areas remain intact, warranting additional investigation.
