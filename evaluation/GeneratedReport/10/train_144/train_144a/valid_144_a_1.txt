The trachea and lumen of both main bronchi are clear, with no pathological occlusion noted within these structures. The ascending aorta exhibits a diameter of 40 mm, demonstrating no signs of dilatation. The pulmonary artery measures 30 mm and presents with notable contraction. Heart size appears diminished. There are no observed calcifications or atherosclerotic changes in the thoracic aorta or coronary arteries, and no densities related to stent materials were seen. A sizable tumefaction observed in the left lung extends from below the left upper paratracheal region and narrows significantly at the left main bronchus, exhibiting a craniocaudal length of close to 20 cm. This abnormal mass warrants further investigation as to whether it is indeed a viable tumor or merely resultant from atelectatic processes. Additionally, disproportionately enlarged lymph nodes approximately 30x25 mm were noted in the anterior mediastinum. Interlobular septa in the upper, middle, and lower right lobes include mild increased thickness. There appears to be an absence of reticulated nodular opacity specifically within the lower lobe of the right lung. Ground glass opacities present in the upper right apex were excluded. Numerous micro-opaque parenchymal nodules are bilaterally noted. An absence of pleural effusion is present on the right, while non-existent on the left side. Degenerative structural changes are observable within bones, although no lytic or destructive lesions were patternized. The presence of pelvicalyceal junction hydronephrosis is suspected on a follow-up exam.
