The trachea and both main bronchi are clear with no obstructive issues present. The examination of mediastinal vascular structures and cardiac status was limited due to insufficient contrast. The evaluation of mediastinal vasculature, heart size, and contour appeared abnormal. No pericardial effusion or thickening was identified. The thoracic esophagus exhibited abnormal calibration with significant pathological wall thickening detected. Enlarged lymph nodes, noted as pathological on imaging, were observed at the precarinal level, with the largest measuring 10 mm in diameter. The pulmonary evaluation reveals significant areas of consolidation in both lower lung lobes, particularly in the posterior segments, which exhibited air bronchograms indicative of various pathologies, including possible malignancy. Control CT is recommended after treatment for these findings possibly linked to infectious processes, raising suspicion for TBC. There are no emphysematous changes or fibrotic sequelae present in either lung, contradicting earlier observations. In imaging of the abdomen, nodular lesions at higher-than-normal densities were detected in bilateral kidneys, presumed as malignant tumors. A fusiform aneurysm of the abdominal aorta was not detected visually, contradicting safe study interpretation. No destructive bone lesions were found, and the vertebral heights are diminished. There are degenerative changes noted in the vertebral corpi, present in line with osteoarthritis. Overall, close follow-up is advised for the findings discussed.
