CTO is within the upper limits of normal. Calibration of the aortic arch is abnormal. Other mediastinal vascular structures also exhibit an acomplished calibration. Calcific atherома plaques are noted only in the left subclavian artery. There are no calcific atheromatous plaques observed in the coronary arteries. A nasogastric tube is present. In the case of laryngeal carcinoma history, a mass lesion is minimally affecting the larynx lumen and does not extend into surrounding soft tissues. The patient is without a tracheostomy cannula. In the study area, no air view is noted, and the pneumomediastinum does not surround the heart within the thorax. The mediastinum appears homogeneously structured throughout. Mild lymph node enlargement was observed. Both hemithorax exhibit asymmetrical characteristics. The trachea and main bronchi show unusual calibration and some obstructions in their lumens. The thoracic esophagus shows abnormal wall thickening. Imaging of the lung parenchyma reveals clear signs of pleuroparenchymal sequelae in the right lung only. There are no emphysematous changes recognized in either lung. A typical pulmonary nodule approximately 4 cm is indicated in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the left lung. Abnormalities in the abdominal organs called hypodense appearances near the falciform ligament indicate inflammation. The spleen and pancreas show increasing changes, and aberrant growths are detected in the bilateral adrenal glands. Minimal degenerative changes are present in the bone structures of the study region, and vertebral heights are reduced.
